abstract = {Patterning of high-quality two-dimensional chalcogenide crystals with unique planar structures and various fascinating electronic properties offers great potential for batch fabrication and integration of electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, it remains a challenge that requires accurate control of the crystallization, thickness, position, orientation and layout. Here we develop a method that combines microintaglio printing with van der Waals epitaxy to efficiently pattern various single-crystal two-dimensional chalcogenides onto transparent insulating mica substrates. Using this approach, we have patterned large-area arrays of two-dimensional single-crystal Bi2Se3 topological insulator with a record high Hall mobility of ∼1,750 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) at room temperature. Furthermore, our patterned two-dimensional In2Se3 crystal arrays have been integrated and packaged to flexible photodetectors, yielding an ultrahigh external photoresponsivity of ∼1,650 A W(-1) at 633 nm. The facile patterning, integration and packaging of high-quality two-dimensional chalcogenide crystals hold promise for innovations of next-generation photodetector arrays, wearable electronics and integrated optoelectronic circuits.},

abstract = {Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been attracting much attentions due to its excellent electrical and optical properties. We report here the synthesis of large-scale and uniform MoS2 nanosheets with vertically standing morphology using chemical vapor deposition method. TEM observations clearly reveal the growth mechanism of these vertical structures. It is suggested that the vertical structures are caused by the compression and extrusion between MoS2 islands. More importantly, the vertical morphology of two dimensional (2D) materials hold many promising potential applications. We demonstrate here the as-synthesized vertically standing MoS2 nanosheets could be used for hydrogen evolution reaction, where the exchange current density is about 70 times of bulk MoS2. The field emission performance of vertically standing MoS2 were also improved due to the abundantly exposed edges.},

abstract = {We review several methods for the calculation of vibrational spectra from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and we present a new implementation in the trajectory analyzer TRAVIS. In particular, we show mass-weighted power spectra, infrared spectra, and Raman spectra with corresponding depolarization ratios, which are based on time-correlation functions of velocities, dipole moments, and polarizabilities, respectively. Using the four organic molecules methanol, acetone, nitromethane, and pinacol as test systems, we compare the spectra from AIMD simulations of the isolated molecules in gas phase to static calculations relying on the harmonic approximation and to experimental spectra recorded in a nonpolar solvent. The AIMD approach turns out to give superior results when anharmonicity effects are of particular importance. Using the example of methanol, we demonstrate the application to bulk phase systems, which are not directly accessible by static calculations, but for which the AIMD spectra also provide a very good approximation to experimental data. Finally, we investigate the influence of simulation time and temperature in the AIMD on the resulting spectra. {\textcopyright} 2013 the Owner Societies.},

abstract = {As a promising non-precious catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER; refs 1-5), molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) is known to contain active edge sites and an inert basal plane. Activating the MoS2 basal plane could further enhance its HER activity but is not often a strategy for doing so. Herein, we report the first activation and optimization of the basal plane of monolayer 2H-MoS2 for HER by introducing sulphur (S) vacancies and strain. Our theoretical and experimental results show that the S-vacancies are new catalytic sites in the basal plane, where gap states around the Fermi level allow hydrogen to bind directly to exposed Mo atoms. The hydrogen adsorption free energy ($\Delta$GH) can be further manipulated by straining the surface with S-vacancies, which fine-tunes the catalytic activity. Proper combinations of S-vacancy and strain yield the optimal $\Delta$GH = 0 eV, which allows us to achieve the highest intrinsic HER activity among molybdenum-sulphide-based catalysts.},

We show how simpler approaches to calculating near-edge structure fail to include the fundamental physics needed to understand the evolution of near-edge structure as a function of probe position and investigate the dependence of near-edge structure on probe size. It is within this framework that density functional theory should be presented, in order to ensure that variations of near-edge structure are truly due to local electronic structure and how much from the diffraction and focusing of the electron beam.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanosheets exhibit remarkable electronic and optical properties. The 2D features, sizable bandgaps and recent advances in the synthesis, characterization and device fabrication of the representative MoS2, WS2, WSe2 and MoSe2 TMDs make TMDs very attractive in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics. Similar to graphite and graphene, the atoms within each layer in 2D TMDs are joined together by covalent bonds, while van der Waals interactions keep the layers together. This makes the physical and chemical properties of 2D TMDs layer-dependent. In this review, we discuss the basic lattice vibrations of 2D TMDs from monolayer, multilayer to bulk material, including high-frequency optical phonons, interlayer shear and layer breathing phonons, the Raman selection rule, layer-number evolution of phonons, multiple phonon replica and phonons at the edge of the Brillouin zone. The extensive capabilities of Raman spectroscopy in investigating the properties of TMDs are discussed, such as interlayer coupling, spin–orbit splitting and external perturbations. The interlayer vibrational modes are used in rapid and substrate-free characterization of the layer number of multilayer TMDs and in probing interface coupling in TMD heterostructures. The success of Raman spectroscopy in investigating TMD nanosheets paves the way for experiments on other 2D crystals and related van der Waals heterostructures.},

abstract = {The lattice structure and symmetry of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials are of key importance to their fundamental mechanical, thermal, electronic, and optical properties. Raman spectroscopy, as a convenient and nondestructive tool, however, has its limitations in identifying all symmetry allowing Raman modes and determining the corresponding crystal structure of 2D layered materials with high symmetry, such as graphene and MoS2. Due to the lower structural symmetry and extraordinary weak interlayer coupling of ReS2, we successfully identify all 18 first-order Raman active modes for bulk and monolayer ReS2. Without a van der Waals correction, our local density approximation (LDA) calculations successfully reproduce all the Raman modes. Our calculations also suggest no surface reconstruction effect and the absence of low frequency rigid-layer Raman modes below 100 cm(-1). Combining Raman spectroscopy and LDA thus provides a general approach for studying the vibrational and structural properties of 2D layered materials with lower symmetry.},

@article{Ugeda2014,
abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are emerging as a new platform for exploring 2D semiconductor physics 1–9 . Reduced screening in two dimensions results in markedly enhanced electron–electron interactions, which have been predicted to generate giant bandgap renormalization and excitonic eeects 10–13 . Here we present a rigorous experimental observation of extraordinarily large exciton binding energy in a 2D semiconducting TMD. We determine the single-particle electronic bandgap of single-layer MoSe 2 by means of scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS), as well as the two-particle exciton transition energy using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. These yield an exciton binding energy of 0.55 eV for monolayer MoSe 2 on graphene—orders of magnitude larger than what is seen in conventional 3D semiconductors and significantly higher than what we see for MoSe 2 monolayers in more highly screening environments. This finding is corroborated by our ab initio GW and Bethe–Salpeter equation calculations 14,15 which include electron correlation eeects. The renormalized bandgap and large exciton binding observed here will have a profound impact on electronic and optoelectronic device technologies based on single-layer semiconducting TMDs. The remarkable properties of atomically thin semiconducting TMD layers include an indirect-to-direct bandgap crossover 1,2,9 , field-induced transport with high on–off ratios 16 , valley-selective circular dichroism 3–6 , and a strong photovoltaic response 17,18 . Fundamental understanding of the electron/hole quasiparticle band structure and many-body interactions in 2D TMDs, however, is still lacking. Enhanced Coulomb interactions due to low-dimensional effects are expected to increase the quasiparticle bandgap as well as to cause electron–hole pairs to form more strongly bound excitons 10–13 . Such effects have been observed previously in other reduced dimensional systems, including carbon nanotubes 19},

@article{Hobbs2000,
abstract = {Spin-polarized calculations in solids have generally been confined to a global quantization axis to simplify both the theoretical model and its implementation in self-consistent codes. This approximation is justified as many materials exhibit a collinear magnetic order. However, in recent years much interest has been directed towards noncollinear magnetism in which the magnetization density is a continuous vector variable of position. In this paper we develop the all-electron projector augmented-wave (PAW) method for noncollinear magnetic structures, based on a generalized local-spin-density theory. The method allows both the atomic and magnetic structures to relax simultaneously and self-consistently. The algorithms have been implemented within a powerful package called VASP (Vienna ab initio simulation package), which has been used successfully for a large variety of different systems such as crystalline and amorphous semiconductors, simple liquids, and transition metals. The approach has been used to study small clusters of Fe and Cr; some of these clusters show noncollinear magnetic arrangements.},

abstract = {In this work, we consider epitaxial growth of thin crystalline films. Thereby, we propose a new diffuse-interface approximation of a semi-continuous model resolving atomic distances in the growth direction but being coarse-grained in the lateral directions. Mathematically, this leads to a free boundary problem proposed by Burton, Cabrera and Frank for steps separating terraces of different atomic heights. The evolution of the steps is coupled to a diffusion equation for the adatom (adsorbed atom) concentration fulfilling Robin-type boundary conditions at the steps. Our approach allows to incorporate an Ehrlich– Schwoebel barrier as well as diffusion along step edges into a diffuse-interface model. This model results in a Cahn–Hilliard equation with a degenerate mobility coupled to diffusion equations on the terraces with a diffuse-interface description of the boundary conditions at the steps. We provide a justification by matched asymptotic expansions formally showing the convergence of the diffuse-interface model towards the sharp-interface model as the interface width shrinks to zero. The results of the asymptotic analysis are numerically reproduced by a finite element discretization.},

This potential is derived from a well-known dissociable hydrocarbon force field, the reactive empirical bond-order potential. The extensions include an adaptive treatment of the nonbonded and dihedral-angle interactions, which still allows for covalent bonding interactions. Torsional potentials are introduced via a novel interaction potential that does not require a fixed hybridization state. The resulting model is intended as a first step towards a transferable, empirical potential capable of simulating chemical reactions in a variety of environments. The current implementation has been validated against structural and energetic properties of both gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons, and is expected to prove useful in simulations of hydrocarbon liquids, thin films, and other saturated hydrocarbon systems.},

abstract = {The thinnest semiconductor, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) monolayer, exhibits promising prospects in the applications of optoelectronics and valleytronics. A uniform and highly crystalline MoS2 monolayer in a large area is highly desirable for both fundamental studies and substantial applications. Here, utilizing various aromatic molecules as seeding promoters, a large-area, highly crystalline, and uniform MoS2 monolayer was achieved with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at a relatively low growth temperature (650 degrees C). The dependence of the growth results on the seed concentration and on the use of different seeding promoters is further investigated. It is also found that an optimized concentration of seed molecules is helpful for the nucleation of the MoS2. The newly identified seed molecules can be easily deposited on various substrates and allows the direct growth of monolayer MoS2 on Au, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and graphene to achieve various hybrid structures.},

We then compare the phonon properties, between an idealized 2-D crystal, realistic 2-D crystals, and 3-D crystals, and present the physical picture on how the thermal conductivity of 2-D materials changes with sample sizes. The geometric effects, such as layer numbers and width, and other physical effects like defects, mechanical strains, and substrates, on the thermal properties of 2-D materials are discussed. We also briefly discuss the challenges in theoretical and experimental studies of phonon and thermal transport in 2-D materials. The rich and special phonon physics in 2-D materials make them promising candidates for exploring novel phenomena like topological phonon effect and applications like phononic quantum devices, as discussed in the outlook.},

abstract = {We present an ab initio direct Ehrenfest dynamics scheme using a three time-step integrator. The three different time steps are implemented with nuclear velocity Verlet, nuclear-position-coupled midpoint Fock integrator, and time-dependent Hartree-Fock with a modified midpoint and unitary transformation algorithm. The computational cost of the ab initio direct Ehrenfest dynamics presented here is found to be only a factor of 2-4 larger than that of Born-Oppenheimer (BO) dynamics. As an example, we compute the vibration of the NaCl molecule and the intramolecular torsional motion of H2 C=N H2+ by Ehrenfest dynamics compared with BO dynamics. For the vibration of NaCl with an initial kinetic energy of 1.16 eV, Ehrenfest dynamics converges to BO dynamics with the same vibrational frequency. The intramolecular rotation of H2 C=N H2+ produces significant electronic excitation in the Ehrenfest trajectory. The amount of nonadiabaticity, suggested by the amplitude of the coherent progression of the excited and ground electronic states, is observed to be directly related to the strength of the electron-nuclear coupling. Such nonadiabaticity is seen to have a significant effect on the dynamics compared with the adiabatic approximation. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

Herein, a novel nanocomposite anode material is designed and synthesized by anchoring red P nanoparticles on a 3D carbon nanosheet framework for K-ion batteries (KIBs). The red P@CN composite demonstrates a superior electrochemical performance with a high reversible capacity of 655 mA h g?1 at 100 mA g?1 and a good rate capability remaining 323.7 mA h g?1 at 2000 mA g?1, which outperform reported anode materials for KIBs. The transmission electron microscopy and theoretical calculation results suggest a one-electron reaction mechanism ofP + K+ + e?? KP, corresponding to a theoretical capacity of 843 mA h g?1,which is the highest value for anode materials investigated for KIBs. The study not only sheds light on the rational design of high performance red P anodes for KIBs but also offers a fundamental understanding of the potassium storage mechanism of red P.},

Monolayers of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides MoS2 or WSe2 have been proposed as promising channel materials for field-effect transistors. Their high mechanical flexibility, stability, and quality coupled with potentially inexpensive production methods offer potential advantages compared to organic and crystalline bulk semiconductors. Due to quantum mechanical confinement, the band gap in monolayer MoS2 is direct in nature, leading to a strong interaction with light that can be exploited for building phototransistors and ultrasensitive photodetectors. Here, we report on the realization of light-emitting diodes based on vertical heterojunctions composed of n-type monolayer MoS2 and p-type silicon. Careful interface engineering allows us to realize diodes showing rectification and light emission from the entire surface of the heterojunction. Electroluminescence spectra show clear signs of direct excitons related to the optical transitions between the conduction and valence bands. Our p-n diodes can also operate as solar cells, with typical external quantum efficiency exceeding 4%. Our work opens up the way to more sophisticated optoelectronic devices such as lasers and heterostructure solar cells based on hybrids of 2D semiconductors and silicon.},

There are, however, other properties of charge carriers that might be exploited in new families of devices. In particular, if there are two or more minima in the conduction band (or maxima in the valence band) in momentum space, and if it is possible to confine charge carriers in one of these valleys, then it should be possible to make a valleytronic device1,2,3,4. Valley polarization, as the selective population of one valley is designated, has been demonstrated using strain5,6 and magnetic fields7,8,9,10, but neither of these approaches allows dynamic control. Here, we demonstrate that optical pumping with circularly polarized light can achieve complete dynamic valley polarization in monolayer MoS2 (refs 11, 12), a two-dimensional non-centrosymmetric crystal with direct energy gaps at two valleys13,14,15,16. Moreover, this polarization is retained for longer than 1 ns.

In addition, the implementation relies on the PAW method, which allows to treat d -states with relatively modest effort and permits the reevaluation of the core-valence interaction on the level of the Hartree-Fock approximation.

The NbS2 and TaS2 sheets have comparable energetic stabilities to the synthesized MoS2 and WS2 ones.

abstract = {Layered semiconductors based on transition-metal chalcogenides usually cross from indirect bandgap in the bulk limit over to direct bandgap in the quantum (2D) limit. Such a crossover can be achieved by peeling off a multilayer sample to a single layer. For exploration of physical behavior and device applications, it is much desired to reversibly modulate such crossover in a multilayer sample. Here we demonstrate that, in a few-layer sample where the indirect bandgap and direct bandgap are nearly degenerate, the temperature rise can effectively drive the system toward the 2D limit by thermally decoupling neighboring layers via interlayer thermal expansion. Such a situation is realized in few-layer MoSe(2), which shows stark contrast from the well-explored MoS(2) where the indirect and direct bandgaps are far from degenerate. Photoluminescence of few-layer MoSe(2) is much enhanced with the temperature rise, much like the way that the photoluminescence is enhanced due to the bandgap crossover going from the bulk to the quantum limit, offering potential applications involving external modulation of optical properties in 2D semiconductors. The direct bandgap of MoSe(2), identified at 1.55 eV, may also promise applications in energy conversion involving solar spectrum, as it is close to the optimal bandgap value of single-junction solar cells and photoelechemical devices.},

The turn-on values are found to be significantly lower than the reported MoS(2) nanoflowers, graphene, and carbon nanotube-based field emitters due to the high field enhancement factor (∼1138) associated with nanometric sharp edges of MoS(2) sheet emitter surface. The emission current-time plots show good stability over a period of 3 h. Owing to the low turn-on field and planar (sheetlike) structure, the MoS(2) could be utilized for future vacuum microelectronics/nanoelectronic and flat panel display applications.},

abstract = {We demonstrate arrays of opioid biosensors based on chemical vapor deposition grown molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) field effect transistors (FETs) coupled to a computationally redesigned, water-soluble variant of the µ -opioid receptor (MOR). By transferring dense films of monolayer MoS2 crystals onto prefabricated electrode arrays, we obtain high-quality FETs with clean surfaces that allow for reproducible protein attachment. The fabrication yield of MoS2 FETs and biosensors exceeds 95%, with an average mobility of 2.0 cm2 V−1 s−1 (36 cm2 V−1 s−1) at room temperature under ambient ( in v ). An atomic length nickel-mediated linker chemistry enables target binding events that occur very close to the MoS2 surface to maximize sensitivity. acuo The biosensor response calibration curve for a synthetic opioid peptide known to bind to the wild- type MOR indicates binding affinity that matches values determined using traditional techniques and a limit of detection $\sim$3 nM (1.5 ng/mL). The combination of scalable array fabrication and rapid, precise binding readout enabled by the MoS2 transistor offers the prospect of a solid-state drug testing platform for rapid readout of the interactions between novel drugs and their intended protein targets.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Chemical Society. The transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) ReS 2 is a promising material for optoelectronic devices because of its remarkable quantum yield. Pressure can effectively tune the optoelectronic properties of TMDs through control of the atomic displacement. Here, we systematically investigated the lattice and electronic structural evolutions of compressed multilayer ReS 2 . Both Raman spectra and first-principles calculations suggest the occurrence of an intralayer phase transition followed by an interlayer transition. A transition from one indirect to another indirect bandgap at 2.7 GPa was revealed by both high-pressure photoluminescence (PL) measurements and first-principles calculations, this behavior was elucidated by considering the fundamental relationship between lattice variation and electronic evolution. Moreover, by comparing the high-pressure behavior of MoS 2 and ReS 2 , we demonstrated interlayer coupling plays a critical role in determining the lattice and electronic structures in compressed TMDs. Our findings suggest the potential application of ReS 2 in fabricating various stacking devices with tailored properties.},

@article{Lourenco-Martins2021,
abstract = {In the last decades, the blossoming of experimental breakthroughs in the domain of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) has triggered a variety of theoretical developments. Those have to deal with completely different situations, from atomically resolved phonon mapping to electron circular dichroism passing by surface plasmon mapping. All of them rely on very different physical approximations and have not yet been reconciled, despite early attempts to do so. As an effort in that direction, we report on the development of a scalar relativistic quantum electrodynamic (QED) approach of the inelastic scattering of fast electrons. This theory can be adapted to describe all modern EELS experiments, and under the relevant approximations, can be reduced to most of the last EELS theories. In that aim, we present in this paper the state of the art and the basics of scalar relativistic QED relevant to the electron inelastic scattering. We then give a clear relation between the two once antagonist descriptions of the EELS, the retarded dyadic Green function, usually applied to describe photonic excitations and the quasi-static mixed dynamic form factor (MDFF), more adapted to describe core electronic excitations of material. Using the photon propagator in a material, expressed in the relevant gauges, as a tool to understand the interaction between a fast electron and a material, we extend this relation to a newly defined quantity, the relativistic MDFF. The relation between the dyadic Green function and the relativistic MDFF does depend only on the photon propagator and not on the specifics of the particle (here, a fast electron) probing the target. Therefore, it can be adapted to any spectroscopy where a relation between the electromagnetic and electronic properties of a material is needed. We then use this theory to establish two important EELS-related equations. The first one relates the spatially resolved EELS to the imaginary part of the photon propagator and the incoming and outgoing electron beam wavefunction, synthesizing the most common theories developed for analyzing spatially resolved EELS experiments. The second one shows that the evolution of the electron beam density matrix is proportional to the mutual coherence tensor, proving that quite universally, the electromagnetic correlations in the target are imprinted in the coherence properties of the probing electron beam.},

abstract = {Twenty years after layer-type metal halide perovskites were successfully developed, 3D metal halide perovskites (shortly, perovskites) were recently rediscovered and are attracting multidisciplinary interest from physicists, chemists, and material engineers. Perovskites have a crystal structure composed of five atoms per unit cell (ABX3) with cation A positioned at a corner, metal cation B at the center, and halide anion X at the center of six planes and unique optoelectronic properties determined by the crystal structure. Because of very narrow spectra (full width at half-maximum <=20 nm), which are insensitive to the crystallite/grain/particle dimension and wide wavelength range (400 nm <= $\lambda$ <= 780 nm), perovskites are expected to be promising high-color purity light emitters that overcome inherent problems of conventional organic and inorganic quantum dot emitters. Within the last 2 y, perovskites have already demonstrated their great potential in light-emitting diodes by showing high electroluminescence efficiency comparable to those of organic and quantum dot light-emitting diodes. This article reviews the progress of perovskite emitters in two directions of bulk perovskite polycrystalline films and perovskite nanoparticles, describes current challenges, and suggests future research directions for researchers to encourage them to collaborate and to make a synergetic effect in this rapidly emerging multidisciplinary field.},

abstract = {We introduce a semiempirical method to comet the systematic equilibrium lattice parameters underestimation present in first principles calculations based on the local density approximation. The method consists in performing calculations under a negative pressure such that the calculated equilibrium volume matches the experimentally observed one. We find that elastic properties obtained under these conditions are typically in better agreement with experiment. We also observe that the negative pressure which needs to be applied to crystalline compound can be reliably interpolated by taking the concentration-weighted average of the pressures determined from purl crystals made of each of the elements present in the compound. In a large class of materials, the knowledge of one pressure per element is thus sufficient to correct most of the bias in lattice constants and elastic properties. We finally propose a simple model of the nonlocal contribution to the exchange-correlations energy that is able to explain the observed linear dependence between the required negative pressure and concentration.

Although Majorana fermions can only exist on the surface of topological superconductors, Dirac and Weyl fermions can be realized in both 2D and 3D materials. The latter are semimetals with Dirac/Weyl cones either not tilted (type I) or tilted (type II). Although both Dirac and Weyl fermions have massless nature with the nontrivial Berry phase, the formation of Weyl fermions in 3D semimetals require either time-reversal or inversion symmetry breaking to lift degeneracy at Dirac points. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that canted antiferromagnetic BaMnSb2 is a 3D Weyl semimetal with a 2D electronic structure. The Shubnikov-de Hass oscillations of the magnetoresistance give nearly zero effective mass with high mobility and the nontrivial Berry phase. The ordered magnetic arrangement (ferromagnetic ordering in the ab plane and antiferromagnetic ordering along the c axis below 286 K) breaks the time-reversal symmetry, thus offering us an ideal platform to study magnetic Weyl fermions in a centrosymmetric material.},

The results are compared with the widely used formula of Seitz and Koehler, based on a low-Z approximation due to McKinley and Feshbach. For low-Z elements, the formula of Seitz and Koehler was found to be accurate. For gold the displacement cross section computed from the Mott series is, in the region of 2-4 MeV bombarding energy, about twice as large as the value obtained from the approximate formula. The behavior of the cross section near threshold and at very high energies has been considered. For high-Z values the displacement cross section shows predominantly a parabolic rise near threshold. At very high energies it falls slowly toward a finite value. The implications of these calculations for various experiments on radiation damage in gold are briefly discussed.},

Due to the van der Waals (vdW) bonding between layers, vdW heterostructures can be constructed between two different species of TMDCs. Most studies employ exfoliation or co-vapor growth schemes, which are limited by the small size and uneven distribution of heterostructures on the growth substrate. In this work we demonstrate a one-step synthesis procedure for large-area vdW heterostructures between horizontal TMDCs MoS2 and WS2. The synthesis procedure is scalable and provides patterning ability, which is critical for electronic applications in integrated circuits. We demonstrate rectification characteristics of large-area MoS2/WS2 stacks. In addition, hydrogen evolution reaction performance was measured in these horizontal MoS2 and WS2 thin films, which indicate that, in addition to the catalytically active sulfur edge sites, defect sites may serve as catalyst sites.},

abstract = {We report resonant Raman scattering of MoS2 layers comprising of single, bi, four and seven layers, showing a strong dependence on the layer thickness. Indirect band gap MoS2 in bulk becomes a direct band gap semiconductor in the monolayer form. New Raman modes are seen in the spectra of single- and few-layer MoS2 samples which are absent in the bulk. The Raman mode at 230 cm−1 appears for two, four and seven layers. This mode has been attributed to the longitudinal acoustic phonon branch at the M point (LA(M)) of the Brillouin zone. The mode at 179 cm−1 shows asymmetric character for a few-layer sample. The asymmetry is explained by the dispersion of the LA(M) branch along the $\Gamma$-M direction. The most intense spectral region near 455 cm−1 shows a layer-dependent variation of peak positions and relative intensities. The high energy region between 510 and 645 cm−1 is marked by the appearance of prominent new Raman bands, varying in intensity with layer numbers. Resonant Raman spectroscopy thus serves as a promising non invasive technique to accurately estimate the thickness of MoS2 layers down to a few atoms thick.

abstract = {Conspectus After the discovery of graphene and the development of powerful exfoliation techniques, experimental preparation of two-dimensional (2D) crystals can be expected for any layered material that is known to chemistry. Besides graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), transition metal chalcogenides (TMC) are among the most studied ultrathin materials. In particular, single-layer MoS2, a direct band gap semiconductor with ∼1.9 eV energy gap, is popular in physics and nanoelectronics, because it nicely complements semimetallic graphene and insulating h-BN monolayer as a construction component for flexible 2D electronics and because it was already successfully applied in the laboratory as basis material for transistors and other electronic and optoelectronic devices. Two-dimensional crystals are subject to significant quantum confinement: compared with their parent layered 3D material, they show different structural, electronic, and optical properties, such as spontaneous rippling as free-standing monolayer, significant changes of the electronic band structure, giant spin-orbit splitting, and enhanced photoluminescence. Most of those properties are intrinsic for the monolayer and already absent for two-layer stacks of the same 2D crystal. For example, single-layer MoS2 is a direct band gap semiconductor with spin-orbit splitting of 150 meV in the valence band, while the bilayer of the same material is an indirect band gap semiconductor without observable spin-orbit splitting. All these properties have been observed experimentally and are in excellent agreement with calculations based on density-functional theory. This Account reports theoretical studies of a subgroup of transition metal dichalcogenides with the composition MX2, with M = Mo, or W and X = Se or S, also referred to as "MoWSeS materials". Results on the electronic structure, quantum confinement, spin-orbit coupling, spontaneous monolayer rippling, and change of electronic properties in the presence of an external electric field are reported. While all materials of the MoWSeS family share the same qualitative properties, their individual values can differ strongly, for example, the spin-orbit splitting in WSe2 reaches the value of 428 meV, nearly three times that of MoS2. Further, we discuss the effect of strain on the electronic properties (straintronics). While MoWSeS single layers are very robust against external electric fields, bilayers show a linear reduction of the band gap, even reaching a semiconductor-metal phase transition, and an increase of the spin-orbit splitting from zero to the monolayer value at rather small fields. Strain is yet another possibility to control the band gap in a linear way, and MoWSeS monolayers become metallic at strain values of ∼10%. The density-functional based tight-binding model is a useful tool to investigate the electronic and structural properties, including electron conductance, of large MoS2 structures, which show spontaneous rippling in finite-temperature molecular dynamics simulations. Structural defects in MoS2 result in anisotropy of the electric conductivity. Finally, DFT predictions on the properties of noble metal dichalcogenides are presented. Most strikingly, 1T PdS2 is an indirect band gap semiconductor in its monolayer form but becomes metallic as a bilayer.},

abstract = {Transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanolayers show potential as high-performance catalysts in energy conversion and storage devices. Synthetic TMDs produced by chemical-vapor deposition (CVD) methods`tend to grow parallel to the growth substrate. Here, we show that with the right precursors and appropriate tuning of the CVD growth conditions, ReS2 nanosheets can be made to orient perpendicular to the growth substrate. This accomplishes two important objectives; first, it drastically increases the wetted or exposed surface area of the ReS2 sheets, and second, it exposes the sharp edges and corners of the ReS2 sheets. We show that these structural features of the vertically grown ReS2 sheets can be exploited to significantly improve their performance as polysulfide immobilizers and electro-chemical catalysts in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries and in hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). After 300 cycles, the specific capacity of the Li-S battery with vertical ReS2 catalyst is retained above 750 mA h g(-1), with only similar to 0.063% capacity decay per cycle, much better than the baseline battery (without ReS2), which shows similar to 0.184% capacity decay per cycle under the same test conditions. As a HER catalyst, the vertical ReS2 provides very small onset overpotential (<100 mV) and an exceptional exchange-current density (similar to 67.6 mu A/cm(2)), which is vastly superior to the baseline electrode without ReS2.},

However, many chemical reactions have relatively high activation energies, putting them beyond the times-scale of conventional molecular dynamics (MD) at modest temperatures. To capture the low-temperature long-lived radical chemistry in atomistic simulations, we have developed a new transition detection scheme for performing Reactive Parallel Replica Dynamics (RPRD) simulation enabling an extended MD time-scales, essentially up to a microsecond using ReaxFF. In the newly implemented event detection scheme, the transition events are identified whenever there is a change in connectivity of any atom. 1-Heptene pyrolysis is chosen as a model system, and RPRD simulations are performed at temperatures as low as 1350K for up to 1 $\mu$s for a system consisting of 40 heptene molecules. The chemical mechanism and the product distribution that were obtained from the RPRD simulation are in reasonable agreement with shock tube experiments.},

@article{McDonnell2014,
abstract = {Achieving low resistance contacts is vital for the realization of nanoelectronic devices based on transition metal dichalcogenides. We find that intrinsic defects in MoS2 dominate the metal/MoS2 contact resistance and provide a low Schottky barrier independent of metal contact work function. Furthermore, we show that MoS2 can exhibit both n-type and p-type conduction at different points on a same sample. We identify these regions independently by complementary characterization techniques and show how the Fermi level can shift by 1 eV over tens of nanometers in spatial resolution. We find that these variations in doping are defect-chemistry-related and are independent of contact metal. This raises questions on previous reports of metal-induced doping of MoS2 since the same metal in contact with MoS2 can exhibit both n- and p-type behavior. These results may provide a potential route for achieving low electron and hole Schottky barrier contacts with a single metal deposition.},

abstract = {The 1T phase of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has been demonstrated in recent experiments to display excellent catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but the catalytic mechanism has not been elucidated so far. Herein, using 1T MoS2 as the prototypical TMD material, we studied the HER activity on its basal plane from periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Compared to the nonreactive basal plane of 2H phase MoS2, the catalytic activity of the basal plane of 1T phase MoS2 mainly arises from its affinity for binding H at the surface S sites. Using the binding free energy ($\Delta$GH) of H as the descriptor, we found that the optimum evolution of H2 will proceed at surface H coverage of 12.5% ∼ 25%. Within this coverage, we examined the reaction energy and barrier for the three elementary steps of the HER process. The Volmer step was found to be facile, whereas the subsequent Heyrovsky reaction is kinetically more favorable than the Tafel reaction. Our results suggest that...},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim. Rhenium disulfide (ReS 2 ) differs fundamentally from other group-VI transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) due to its low structural symmetry, which results in its optical and electrical anisotropy. Although vertical growth is observed in some TMDs under special growth conditions, vertical growth in ReS 2 is very different in that it is highly spontaneous and substrate-independent. In this study, the mechanism that underpins the thermodynamically favorable vertical growth mode of ReS 2 is uncovered. It is found that the governing mechanism for ReS 2 growth involves two distinct stages. In the first stage, ReS 2 grows parallel to the growth substrate, consistent with conventional TMD growth. However, subsequent vertical growth is nucleated at points on the lattice where Re atoms are "pinched" together. At such sites, an additional Re atom binds with the cluster of pinched Re atoms, leaving an under-coordinated S atom protruding out of the ReS 2 plane. This under-coordinated S is "reactive" and binds to free Re and S atoms, initiating growth in a direction perpendicular to the ReS 2 surface. The utility of such vertical ReS 2 arrays in applications where high surface-to-volume ratio and electric-field enhancement are essential, such as surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy, field emission, and solar-based disinfection of bacteria, is demonstrated.},

The two excitons show strongly correlated interexcitonic dynamic, in which the transient blue-shifted excitonic absorption originates from the internal A-B excitonic interaction. The observed complex spectral response is determined by the exciton collision-induced linewidth broadening; the broadening of the B-exciton linewidth in turn lowers the peak spectral amplitude of the A exciton.

In this paper we demonstrate how more interpretable images might be obtained by scanning with a focused coherent probe and incoherently averaging the energy-filtered images over probe position. We dub this new imaging technique energy-filtered imaging scanning transmission electron microscopy (EFISTEM). We develop a theoretical framework for EFISTEM and show that it is in fact equivalent to precession EFTEM, where the plane wave illumination is precessed through a range of tilts spanning the same range of angles as the probe forming aperture in EFISTEM. It is demonstrated that EFISTEM delivers similar results to scanning transmission electron microscopy with an electron energy-loss spectrometer but has the advantage that it is immune to coherent aberrations and spatial incoherence of the probe and is also more resilient to scan distortions.},

abstract = {A methodology for coupling multiple length scales in chemical vapor deposition processes is presented. A reactor scale model (RSM), used for the description of the macro-scale in the bulk, is coupled with a feature scale model (FSM), used for the description of the topography evolution of the micro-scale features (e.g. trenches or holes) on the wafer. The RSM is implemented with a commercial package and the FSM is implemented by combining a ballistic model for the transport and a profile evolution algorithm based on the level set method. The coupling of the RSM with the FSM is performed through the correction of the boundary condition for the species consumption along the wafer. Essentially, the pre-exponential factor of the Arrhenius expression for the surface reaction(s) is locally corrected along the wafer and this correction allows taking into account the micro-topography on the wafer without including it in the computational domain of the RSM. The coupling methodology implements flow of information in both directions, i.e. from the RSM to the FSM and backwards. Tungsten deposition from tungsten hexafluoride and hydrogen is the case studied. The reactor is axisymmetric and the wafer includes a series of trenches with dimensions at the micro-scale. The effect of the deposition time and the density (number) of trenches on the wafer on (a) the species' consumption on the wafer and (b) the trench profile evolution is investigated. The loading phenomenon, i.e. the depletion of reactants due to their increased consumption on the micro-topography on the wafer surface is predicted. The importance of the feedback from the micro-scale (to the macro-scale) is demonstrated by comparing trench profiles produced with and without feedback. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Atomically thin molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is an ideal semiconductor material for field-effect transistors (FETs) with sub-10 nm channel lengths. The high effective mass and large bandgap of MoS2 minimize direct source–drain tunneling, while its atomically thin body maximizes the gate modulation efficiency in ultrashort-channel transistors. However, no experimental study to date has approached the sub-10 nm scale due to the multiple challenges related to nanofabrication at this length scale and the high contact resistance traditionally observed in MoS2 transistors. Here, using the semiconducting-to-metallic phase transition of MoS2, we demonstrate sub-10 nm channel-length transistor fabrication by directed self-assembly patterning of mono- and trilayer MoS2. This is done in a 7.5 nm half-pitch periodic chain of transistors where semiconducting (2H) MoS2 channel regions are seamlessly connected to metallic-phase (1T′) MoS2 access and contact regions. The resulting 7.5 nm channel-length MoS2 FET has a low ...},

abstract = {Solar energy is readily available in most climates and can be used for water purification. However, solar disinfection of drinking water mostly relies on ultraviolet light, which represents only 4% of the total solar energy, and this leads to a slow treatment speed. Therefore, the development of new materials that can harvest visible light for water disinfection, and so speed up solar water purification, is highly desirable. Here we show that few-layered vertically aligned MoS2 (FLV-MoS2) films can be used to harvest the whole spectrum of visible light (∼50% of solar energy) and achieve highly efficient water disinfection. The bandgap of MoS2 was increased from 1.3 to 1.55 eV by decreasing the domain size, which allowed the FLV-MoS2 to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) for bacterial inactivation in the water. The FLV-MoS2 showed a ∼15 times better log inactivation efficiency of the indicator bacteria compared with that of bulk MoS2, and a much faster inactivation of bacteria under both visible light and sunlight illumination compared with the widely used TiO2. Moreover, by using a 5 nm copper film on top of the FLV-MoS2 as a catalyst to facilitate electron–hole pair separation and promote the generation of ROS, the disinfection rate was increased a further sixfold. With our approach, we achieved water disinfection of >99.999% inactivation of bacteria in 20min with a small amount of material (1.6mg l–1)under simulated visible light.},

abstract = {Photon-based spectroscopies have played a central role in exploring the electronic properties of crystalline solids and thin films. Though they remain a powerful tool for probing the electronic properties of nanostructures, they are limited by lack of spatial resolution. On the other hand, electron-based spectroscopies, e.g., electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), are now capable of subangstrom spatial resolution. Core-loss EELS, a spatially resolved analog of x-ray absorption, has been used extensively in the study of inhomogeneous complex systems. In this paper, we demonstrate that low-loss EELS in an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope, which probes low-energy excitations, combined with a theoretical framework for simulating and analyzing the spectra, is a powerful tool to probe low-energy electron excitations with atomic-scale resolution. The theoretical component of the method combines density functional theory-based calculations of the excitations with dynamical scattering theory for the electron beam. We apply the method to monolayer graphene in order to demonstrate that atomic-scale contrast is inherent in low-loss EELS even in a perfectly periodic structure. The method is a complement to optical spectroscopy as it probes transitions entailing momentum transfer. The theoretical analysis identifies the spatial and orbital origins of excitations, holding the promise of ultimately becoming a powerful probe of the structure and electronic properties of individual point and extended defects in both crystals and inhomogeneous complex nanostructures. The method can be extended to probe magnetic and vibrational properties with atomic resolution.},

First, we confirmed that as the number of layers increase, the E', E″ and E2g modes shift to lower frequencies, and the A'1 and A1g modes shift to higher frequencies. Second, new high frequency first order A'1 and A1g modes appear, explaining recently reported experimental data for WSe2, MoSe2 and MoS2. Third, splitting of modes around A'1 and A1g is found which explains those observed in MoSe2. Finally, exterior and interior layers possess different vibrational frequencies.

However, formation of dendrites on such K-metal surfaces is inevitable, which prevents their utilization. Here, we report that K dendrites can be healed in situ in a K-metal battery. The healing is triggered by current-controlled, self-heating at the electrolyte/dendrite interface, which causes migration of surface atoms away from the dendrite tips, thereby smoothening the dendritic surface. We discover that this process is strikingly more efficient for K as compared to Li metal. We show that the reason for this is the far greater mobility of surface atoms in K relative to Li metal, which enables dendrite healing to take place at an order-of-magnitude lower current density. We demonstrate that the K-metal anode can be coupled with a potassium cobalt oxide cathode to achieve dendrite healing in a practical full-cell device.},

These parameters are obtained from quantum- chemistry calculations on the monomers, and used without further adaptation directly for intermolecular interactions. The approach works very well as shown here for four dimers, where high-level coupled cluster with singles and doubles, and perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) and density functional theory (DFT) Swart-Sola `-Bickelhaupt functional including Grimme's dispersion correction (SSB-D) reference data are available for comparison. The energy surfaces for the three methods are very similar, which is also the case for the interaction between a water molecule with either a chloride anion or a sodium cation. These latter systems had previously been used to criticize Thole's damped point-dipole method, but here we show that with the correct use of the method, it is perfectly able to describe the intermolecular interactions. This is most obvious for the induced dipole moment as function of the chloride–oxygen distance, where the direct (discrete) reaction field results are virtually indistinguishable from those obtained at CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ.},

A 3D topological insulator supports novel spin polarized 2D Dirac fermions on its surface. In this Colloquium article we will review the theoretical foundation for these electronic states and describe recent experiments in which their signatures have been observed. We will describe transport experiments on HgCdTe quantum wells that demonstrate the existence of the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator.

We will then describe exotic states that can occur at the surface of a 3D topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric effect. A superconducting energy gap leads to a state that supports Majorana fermions, and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological quantum computation.

Triangle-shaped holes appear in accordance with the crystallographic orientation of each layer. Defects are compared to those observed in graphene membranes. The observation of clean single-layer membranes shows that hexagonal boron nitride is a further material (in addition to graphene) that can exist in a quasi-two-dimensional allotrope without the need for a substrate.},

abstract = {This article reviews the theory of electron-phonon interactions in solids from the point of view of ab-initio calculations. While the electron-phonon interaction has been studied for almost a century, predictive non-empirical calculations have become feasible only during the past two decades. Today it is possible to calculate from first principles many materials properties related to the electron-phonon interaction, including the critical temperature of conventional superconductors, the carrier mobility in semiconductors, the temperature dependence of optical spectra in direct and indirect-gap semiconductors, the relaxation rates of photoexcited carriers, the electron mass renormalization in angle-resolved photoelectron spectra, and the non-adiabatic corrections to phonon dispersion relations. Here we review the theoretical and computational framework underlying modern electron-phonon calculations from first principles, as well as landmark investigations of the electron-phonon interaction in real materials. In the first part of the article we summarize the elementary theory of electron-phonon interactions and their calculations based on density-functional theory. In the second part we discuss a general field-theoretic formulation of the electron-phonon problem, and establish the connection with practical first-principles calculations. In the third part we review a number of recent investigations of electron-phonon interactions in the areas of vibrational spectroscopy, photoelectron spectoscopy, optical spectroscopy, transport, and superconductivity.},

@article{Shang2016,
abstract = {Unprecedented interest has been spurred recently in two-dimensional (2D) layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) that possess tunable electronic and optical properties. However, synthesis of a wafer-scale TMD thin film with controlled layers and homogeneity remains highly challenging due mainly to the lack of thermodynamic and diffusion knowledge, which can be used to understand and design process conditions, but falls far behind the rapidly growing TMD field. Here, an integrated density functional theory (DFT) and calculation of phase diagram (CALPHAD) modeling approach is employed to provide thermodynamic insight into lateral versus vertical growth of the prototypical 2D material MoS2. Various DFT energies are predicted from the layer-dependent MoS2, 2D flake-size related mono- and bilayer MoS2, to Mo and S migrations with and without graphene and sapphire substrates, thus shedding light on the factors that control lateral versus vertical growth of 2D islands. For example, the monolayer MoS2 flake in a small 2D lateral size is thermodynamically favorable with respect to the bilayer counterpart, indicating the monolayer preference during the initial stage of nucleation; while the bilayer MoS2 flake becomes stable with increasing 2D lateral size. The critical 2D flake-size of phase stability between mono- and bilayer MoS2 is adjustable via the choice of substrate. In terms of DFT energies and CALPHAD modeling, the size dependent pressure–temperature–composition (P-T-x) growth windows are predicted for MoS2, indicating that the formation of MoS2 flake with reduced size appears in the middle but close to the lower T and higher P “Gas + MoS2” phase region. It further suggests that Mo diffusion is a controlling factor for MoS2 growth owing to its extremely low diffusivity compared to that of sulfur. Calculated MoS2 energies, Mo and S diffusivities, and size-dependent P-T-x growth windows are in good accord with available experiments, and the present data provide quantitative insight into the controlled growth of 2D layered MoS2.},

The 2D features, sizable bandgaps and recent advances in the synthesis, characterization and device fabrication of the representative MoS2, WS2, WSe2 and MoSe2 TMDs make TMDs very attractive in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics. Similar to graphite and graphene, the atoms within each layer in 2D TMDs are joined together by covalent bonds, while van der Waals interactions keep the layers together. This makes the physical and chemical properties of 2D TMDs layer-dependent. In this review, we discuss the basic lattice vibrations of 2D TMDs from monolayer, multilayer to bulk material, including high-frequency optical phonons, interlayer shear and layer breathing phonons, the Raman selection rule, layer-number evolution of phonons, multiple phonon replica and phonons at the edge of the Brillouin zone. The extensive capabilities of Raman spectroscopy in investigating the properties of TMDs are discussed, such as interlayer coupling, spin-orbit splitting and external perturbations. The interlayer vibrational modes are used in rapid and substrate-free characterization of the layer number of multilayer TMDs and in probing interface coupling in TMD heterostructures. The success of Raman spectroscopy in investigating TMD nanosheets paves the way for experiments on other 2D crystals and related van der Waals heterostructures.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a new phase-field model including combined effects of edge diffusion, the EhrlichSchwoebel barrier, deposition and desorption to simulate epitaxial growth. A new free energy function together with a correction to the initial phase variable profile is used to efficiently capture the morphological evolution when a large deposition flux is imposed. A formal matched asymptotic analysis is performed to show the reduction of the phase-field model to the classical sharp interface BurtonCabreraFrank model for step flow when the interfacial thickness vanishes. The phase-field model is solved by a semi-implicit finite difference scheme, and adaptive block-structured Cartesian meshes are used to dramatically increase the efficiency of the solver. The numerical scheme is used to investigate the evolution of perturbed circularly shaped small islands. The effect of edge diffusion is investigated together with the EhrlichSchwoebel barrier. We also investigate the linear and nonlinear regimes of a step meandering instability. We reproduce the predicted scaling law for the growth of the meander amplitude, which was based on an analysis of a long wavelength regime. New nonlinear behavior is observed when the meander wavelength is comparable to the terrace width. In particular, a previously unobserved regime of coarsening dynamics is found to occur when the meander wavelength is comparable to the terrace width. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Overall, very good agreement is found for the structural properties and phonon dispersions, with the exception of the c∕a ratio in graphite and the associated elastic constants and phonon dispersions. Both the C33 elastic constant and the $\Gamma$ to A phonon dispersions are brought to close agreement with available data once the experimental c∕a is chosen for the calculations. The vibrational free energy and the thermal expansion, the temperature dependence of the elastic moduli and the specific heat are calculated using the quasiharmonic approximation. Graphite shows a distinctive in-plane negative thermal-expansion coefficient that reaches its lowest value around room temperature, in very good agreement with experiments. Thermal contraction in graphene is found to be three times as large; in both cases, bending acoustic modes are shown to be responsible for the contraction, in a direct manifestation of the membrane effect predicted by Lifshitz over 50 years ago. Stacking directly affects the bending modes, explaining the large numerical difference between the thermal-contraction coefficients in graphite and graphene, notwithstanding their common physical origin.},

Triclinic rhenium disulphide (ReS2) is a promising candidate for postsilicon electronics because of its unique optic-electronic properties. The electrical and optical properties of ReS2 under high pressure, however, remain unclear. Here we present a joint experimental and theoretical study on the structure, electronic, and vibrational properties, and visible-light responses of ReS2 up to 50 GPa. There is a direct-to-indirect band-gap transition in 1T-ReS2 under low-pressure regime up to 5 GPa. Upon further compression, 1T-ReS2 undergoes a structural transition to distorted-1T′ phase at 7.7 GPa, followed by the isostructural metallization at 38.5 GPa. Both in situ Raman spectrum and electronic structure analysis reveal that interlayer sulfur-sulfur interaction is greatly enhanced during compression, leading to the remarkable modifications on the electronic properties observed in our subsequent experimental measurements, such as band-gap closure and enhanced photoresponsiveness. This study demonstrates the critical role of pressure in tuning materials properties and the potential usage of layered ReS2 for pressure-responsive optoelectronic applications.},

The quasiparticle (QP) band structures with spin−orbit coupling are calculated in the G0W0 approximation, and comparison is made with different density functional theory descriptions. Pitfalls related to the convergence of GW calculations for two-dimensional (2D) materials are discussed together with possible solutions. The monolayer band edge positions relative to vacuum are used to estimate the band alignment at various heterostructure interfaces. The sensitivity of the band structures to the in-plane lattice constant is analyzed and rationalized in terms of the electronic structure. Finally, the q-dependent dielectric functions and effective electron and hole masses are obtained from the QP band structure and used as input to a 2D hydrogenic model to estimate exciton binding energies. Throughout the paper we focus on trends and correlations in the electronic structure rather than detailed analysis of specific materials. All the computed data is available in an open database.},

In this Perspective, we summarize the recent developments in the field of solar water splitting using 2D materials and review a computational screening approach to rapidly and efficiently discover more 2D materials that possess properties suitable for solar water splitting. Computational tools based on density-functional theory can predict the intrinsic properties of potential photocatalyst such as their electronic properties, optical absorbance, and solubility in aqueous solutions. Computational tools enable the exploration of possible routes to enhance the photocatalytic activity of 2D materials by use of mechanical strain, bias potential, doping, and pH.

abstract = {The ability to intercalate guest species into the van der Waals gap of 2D layered materials affords the opportunity to engineer the electronic structures for a variety of applications. Here we demonstrate the continuous tuning of layer vertically aligned MoS2 nanofilms through electrochemical intercalation of Li(+) ions. By scanning the Li intercalation potential from high to low, we have gained control of multiple important material properties in a continuous manner, including tuning the oxidation state of Mo, the transition of semiconducting 2H to metallic 1T phase, and expanding the van der Waals gap until exfoliation. Using such nanofilms after different degree of Li intercalation, we show the significant improvement of the hydrogen evolution reaction activity. A strong correlation between such tunable material properties and hydrogen evolution reaction activity is established. This work provides an intriguing and effective approach on tuning electronic structures for optimizing the catalytic activity.},

We develop a first-principles approach combining density functional theory (DFT), the GW approximation, and a semiclassical image-charge model to compute the electronic band gaps in planar 1D systems in weak interaction with the surrounding environment. Application of our method to the specific case of GNRs yields good agreement with the range of available experimental data and shows that the band gap of substrate-supported GNRs are reduced by several tenths of an electronvolt compared to their isolated counterparts, with a width and orientation-dependent renormalization. Our results indicate that the band gaps in GNRs can be tuned by controlling screening at the interface by changing the surrounding dielectric materials.},

abstract = {The dynamic fullerene self-assembly process during benzene combustion was studied using classical Reactive Force Field (ReaxFF) nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In order to drive the combustion process, the hydrogen to carbon (H/C) ratio was gradually reduced during the course of the MD simulations. Target temperatures of 2500 and 3000 K were maintained by using a Berendsen thermostat. Simulation conditions and hydrogen removal strategies were chosen to match closely a previous quantum chemical MD (QM/MD) study based on the density-functional tight-binding (DFTB) potential ( Saha et al. ACS Nano 2009, 3, 2241 ) to allow a comparison between the two different potentials. Twenty trajectories were computed at each target temperature, and hydrocarbon cluster size, CxHy composition, average carbon cluster curvature, carbon hybridization type, and ring count statistics were recorded as a function of time. Similarly as in the QM/MD simulations, only giant fullerene cages in the range from 155 to 212 carbon atoms self-assembled, and no C60 cages were observed. The most notable difference concerned the time required for completing cage self-assembly: Depending on temperature, it takes between 50 and 150 ps in DFTB/MD simulations but never less than 100 ps and frequently several 100s ps in ReaxFF/MD simulations. In the present system, the computational cost of ReaxFF/MD is about 1 order of magnitude lower than that of the corresponding DFTB/MD. Overall, the ReaxFF/MD simulations method paints a qualitatively similar picture of fullerene formation in benzene combustion when compared to direct MD simulations based on the DFTB potential.},

In the first part the application of Pulay's DIIS method (direct inversion in the iterative subspace) to the iterative diagonalization of large matrices will be discussed. Our approach is stable, reliable, and minimizes the number of order Natoms3 operations. In the second part, we will discuss an efficient mixing scheme also based on Pulay's scheme. A special ‘‘metric'' and a special ‘‘preconditioning'' optimized for a plane-wave basis set will be introduced. Scaling of the method will be discussed in detail for non-self-consistent and self-consistent calculations. It will be shown that the number of iterations required to obtain a specific precision is almost independent of the system size. Altogether an order Natoms2 scaling is found for systems containing up to 1000 electrons. If we take into account that the number of k points can be decreased linearly with the system size, the overall scaling can approach Natoms. We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VASP (Vienna ab initio simulation package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semiconducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals, and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable. {\textcopyright} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Monolayer tungsten disulfides (WS2) constitute a high quantum yield two-dimensional (2D) system, and can be synthesized on a large area using chemical vapor deposition (CVD), suggesting promising nanophotonics applications. However, spatially nonuniform photoluminescence (PL) intensities and peak wavelengths observed in single WS2 grains have puzzled researchers, with the origins of variation in relative contributions of excitons, trions, and biexcitons to the PL emission not well understood. Here, we present nanoscale PL and Raman spectroscopy images of triangular CVD-grown WS2 monolayers of different sizes, with these images obtained under different temperatures and values of excitation power. Intense PL emissions were observed around the edges of individual WS2 grains and the grain boundaries between partly merged WS2 grains. The predominant origin of the main PL emission from these regions changed from neutral excitons to trions and biexcitons with increasing laser excitation power, with biexcitons completely dominating the PL emission for the high-power condition. The intense PL emission and the preferential formation of biexcitons in the edges and grain boundaries of monolayer WS2 were attributed to larger population of charge carriers caused by the excessive incorporation of growth promoters during the CVD, suggesting positive roles of excessive carriers in the PL efficiency of TMD monolayers. Our comprehensive nanoscale spectroscopic investigation sheds light on the dynamic competition between exciton complexes occurring in monolayer WS2, suggesting a rich variety of ways to engineer new nanophotonic functions using 2D transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers.},

abstract = {It is well established that defects strongly influence properties in two-dimensional materials. For graphene, atomic defects activate the Raman-active centrosymmetric A1g ring-breathing mode known as the D-peak. The relative intensity of this D-peak compared to the G-band peak is the most widely accepted measure of the quality of graphene films. However, no such metric exists for monolayer semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides such as WS2 or MoS2. Here we intentionally create atomic-scale defects in the hexagonal lattice of pristine WS2 and MoS2 monolayers using plasma treatments and study the evolution of their Raman and photoluminescence spectra. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy confirms plasma-induced creation of atomic-scale point defects in the monolayer sheets. We find that while the Raman spectra of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (at 532 nm excitation) are insensitive to defects, their photoluminescence reveals a distinct defect-related spectral feature located ∼0.1 eV below the neutral free A-exciton peak. This peak originates from defect-bound neutral excitons and intensifies as the two-dimensional (2D) sheet is made more defective. This spectral feature is observable in air under ambient conditions (room temperature and atmospheric pressure), which allows for a relatively simple way to determine the defectiveness of 2D semiconducting nanosheets. Controlled defect creation could also enable tailoring of the optical properties of these materials in optoelectronic device applications.},

abstract = {Looking at the science and production methods of group 6 transition metal dichalcogenide (MoS 2 , WSe 2 , etc. ) nanomaterials from the viewpoint of technological applications. Group 6 transition metal dichalcogenides (G6-TMDs), most notably MoS 2 , MoSe 2 , MoTe 2 , WS 2 and WSe 2 , constitute an important class of materials with a layered crystal structure. Various types of G6-TMD nanomaterials, such as nanosheets, nanotubes and quantum dot nano-objects and flower-like nanostructures, have been synthesized. High thermodynamic stability under ambient conditions, even in atomically thin form, made nanosheets of these inorganic semiconductors a valuable asset in the existing library of two-dimensional (2D) materials, along with the well-known semimetallic graphene and insulating hexagonal boron nitride. G6-TMDs generally possess an appropriate bandgap (1–2 eV) which is tunable by size and dimensionality and changes from indirect to direct in monolayer nanosheets, intriguing for (opto)electronic, sensing, and solar energy harvesting applications. Moreover, rich intercalation chemistry and abundance of catalytically active edge sites make them promising for fabrication of novel energy storage devices and advanced catalysts. In this review, we provide an overview on all aspects of the basic science, physicochemical properties and characterization techniques as well as all existing production methods and applications of G6-TMD nanomaterials in a comprehensive yet concise treatment. Particular emphasis is placed on establishing a linkage between the features of production methods and the specific needs of rapidly growing applications of G6-TMDs to develop a production-application selection guide. Based on this selection guide, a framework is suggested for future research on how to bridge existing knowledge gaps and improve current production methods towards technological application of G6-TMD nanomaterials.},

abstract = {An exact stochastic simulation of the Schroedinger equation for charged bosons and fermions has been used to calculate the correlation energies, to locate the transitions to their respective crystal phases at zero temperature within 10%, and to establish the stability at intermediate densities of a ferromagnetic fluid of electrons. PACS numbers: 67.90.+i, 71.45.6m The properties of the ground state of the elec-tron gas, also referred to as the fermion one-component plasma and jellium, have rigorously only been established in the limit of high densi-ties' where the system approaches a perfect gas and at low density' where the electrons crystal-lize. Further more, Hartr ee-Fock calculations' and variational calculations4 suggest that at inter-mediate densities, the spin-aligned state of the electrons will be more stable than the normal, unpolarized state. Precise calculations of this many-fermion system are required to establish the regions of stability of the various phases be-cause of the small energy differences among them. This note outlines a Monte Carlo method that, if run long enough on a computer, can give as precise a solution for the ground state of a given fermion system as desired. In practice, the precision of such a calculation is limited to about two orders of magnitude small-er than that of an approximate trial wave func-tion that is introduced as an importance function in the Monte Carlo process. That the introduc-tion of such an importance function is essential was previously demonstrated for the many-boson problem. ' The extension of this boson calcula-tion to fermions requires dealing with antisym-metric functions whose nodes are unknown. This leads to two related complications; namely, the probability density of a random walk cannot be chosen everywhere positive, and unless prevented the random walk will always converge to the all positive, boson ground state. It is demonstrated here that by representing the wave function by the difference between two probability densities, the effect of this inherent instability becomes serious, and it is possible to extract the proper-ties of the lowest antisymmetric state. A more general procedure which removes the effects of the instability has yet to be perfected. The solution of the fermion problem was car-ried out in two steps. In the first step the nodes, the places where the trial function vanishes, act as fixed absorbing barriers to the diffusion proc-ess. Inside a connected nodal region the wave function is everywhere positive and vanishes at the boundaries. With these boundary conditions, the fermion problem is equivalent to a boson problem. The energy calculated with this proce-dure, which we will refer to as the "fixed-node" energy, is an upper bound to the exact fermion ground-state energy and generally very close to it. In principle one could next vary the nodal loca-tions to obtain the best upper bound, for example, by varying the functions used as elements in the Slater determinant of the trial wave function. In practice, the highly dimensional nodal surfaces are difficult to parametrize in a systematic fash-ion. The second step, called "nodal relaxation, " begins with the population of walks from the "fixed-node" approximation. In this second proce-dure, if a random walk strays across the node of the trial function it is not terminated, but the sign of its contribution to any average is re-versed. At any stage of the random walk there is a population of positive walks (those that re-mained in the same nodal region or crossed an even number of nodes) and a population of nega-tive walks (those that crossed an odd number of nodes). The importance function used in this process is the absolute value of the trial function. It can be easily shown that the difference popula-tion converges to the antisymmetric eigenfunc-tion. However, both the positive and negative populations grow geometrically with a rate equal to the difference between the Fermi and Bose en-ergies. If the relaxation time from the fixed-node 566 1980 The American Physical Society VOLUME 45, NUMBER 7 PHYSICAL RKVIKW LETTERS 18 AUGvsr 1980 r E f T where B is the Hamiltonian 2 (2) It is easily verified that for large times, f(r, t) = 4ry, exp[-t(E " f — E,)j, where E, and p, are the exact eigenvalue and eigenfunction. The above equation for f(R, t) has a simple interpretation as a stochastic process. Each member of the en-semble of systems undergoes (i) random diffu-sion caused by the zero-point motion, (ii) bias-ing or drift by the trial quantum force, Vln1@r1', and (iii) branching with probability given by the time step times the difference between the local trial energy, Er=H+r/4r, and the arbitrarily chosen reference energy, E " f. By *'branching", it is meant that a particular system is either eliminated from the ensemble (if the local energy is greater than the reference energy) or dupli-cated in the ensemble (otherwise). A steady-state population of the ensemble requires that the reference energy equal the lowest eigenvalue. This is one way of determining the eigenvalue. The trial wave function employed in the present calculations is identical with those used in an earlier Monte Carlo variational calculation. This trial function is a product of two-body cor-relation factors times a Slater determinant of single-particle orbitals. The two-body correla-tion factors are chosen such that they remove distribution times this energy difference is less than unity, the fermion energy can be reliably extracted. We have found that for the electron gas this condition is satisfied if the nodes of the Hartree-Fock wave function are used. our simulation method is a simpler version of the Green's function Monte Carlo method of Kalos, Levesque, and Verlet. ' However, it requires numerical truncation. A trial wave function Cr(R) of the Bijl-Jastrow-Slater type4 and an ensemble of about 100 systems are selected from a varia-tional Monte Carlo calculation, where R repre-sents the 3N spatial coordinates of the system of N electrons.

abstract = {Two-dimensional materials are an emerging class of new materials with a wide range of electrical properties and potential practical applications. Although graphene is the most well-studied two-dimensional material, single layers of other materials, such as insulating BN (ref. 2) and semiconducting MoS2 (refs 3, 4) or WSe2 (refs 5, 6), are gaining increasing attention as promising gate insulators and channel materials for field-effect transistors. Because monolayer MoS2 is a direct-bandgap semiconductor due to quantum-mechanical confinement, it could be suitable for applications in optoelectronic devices where the direct bandgap would allow a high absorption coefficient and efficient electron-hole pair generation under photoexcitation. Here, we demonstrate ultrasensitive monolayer MoS2 phototransistors with improved device mobility and ON current. Our devices show a maximum external photoresponsivity of 880 A W(-1) at a wavelength of 561 nm and a photoresponse in the 400-680 nm range. With recent developments in large-scale production techniques such as liquid-scale exfoliation and chemical vapour deposition-like growth, MoS2 shows important potential for applications in MoS2-based integrated optoelectronic circuits, light sensing, biomedical imaging, video recording and spectroscopy.},

Using a combination of transmission electron microscopy and transport measurements, we demonstrate here the direct correlation of electron transport anisotropy in single-layered ReS2 with the atomic orientation of the DS-chains, as also supported by our density functional theory calculations. We further show that the direction of conducting channels in ReS2 and ReSe2 can be controlled by electron beam irradiation at elevated temperatures and follows the strain induced to the sample. Furthermore, high chalcogen deficiency can induce a structural transformation to a non-stoichiometric phase, which is again strongly direction-dependent.

We collected diffraction patterns from a focused electron beam for each real-space scan position with a high-speed, high dynamic range, momentum-resolved detector-the electron microscope pixel array detector (EMPAD). The resulting four-dimensional (4D) phase space data sets contain the full spatially resolved lattice information on the sample.

Noble metals (for example, gold and silver) have been demonstrated to reduce carbon dioxide at moderate rates and low overpotentials. Nevertheless, the development of inexpensive systems with an efficient carbon dioxide reduction capability remains a challenge. Here we identify molybdenum disulphide as a promising cost-effective substitute for noble metal catalysts. We uncover that molybdenum disulphide shows superior carbon dioxide reduction performance compared with the noble metals with a high current density and low overpotential (54 mV) in an ionic liquid. Scanning transmission electron microscopy analysis and first principle modelling reveal that the molybdenum-terminated edges of molybdenum disulphide are mainly responsible for its catalytic performance due to their metallic character and a high d-electron density. This is further experimentally supported by the carbon dioxide reduction performance of vertically aligned molybdenum disulphide.},

Simultaneously, a new absorption edge appeared at 1.1 eV below the conduction band of SiC. The irradiation with heavy ions at 1016 ions/cm2 converts WSe2 into a mixture of WOx and Se-deficient WSe2. The valence band is also heavily altered due to oxidation and amorphization. However, these doses are in excess of the doses needed to damage TMD-based electronics due to defects generated in common dielectric and substrate materials. As such, the radiation stability of WSe2-based electronics is not expected to be limited by the radiation hardness of WSe2, but rather by the dielectric and substrate.},

Our method relies on the summation of interatomic C6 coefficients, derived from the electron density of a molecule or solid and accurate reference data for the free atoms. The mean absolute error in the C6 coefficients is 5.5% when compared to accurate experimental values for 1225 intermolecular pairs, irrespective of the employed exchange-correlation functional. We show that the effective atomic C6 coefficients depend strongly on the bonding environment of an atom in a molecule. Finally, we analyze the van der Waals radii and the damping function in the C6R(-6) correction method for density-functional theory calculations.},

abstract = {Materials characterization remains a significant, time-consuming undertaking. Generally speaking, spectroscopic techniques are used in conjunction with empirical and ab-initio calculations in order to elucidate structure. These experimental and computational methods typically require significant human input and interpretation, particularly with regards to novel materials. Recently, the application of data mining and machine learning to problems in material science have shown great promise in reducing this overhead. In the work presented here, several aspects of machine learning are explored with regards to characterizing a model material, titania, using solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Specifically, a large dataset is generated, corresponding to NMR $^{47}$Ti spectra, using ab-initio calculations for generated TiO$_2$ structures. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) reveals that input spectra may be compressed by more than 90%, before being used for subsequent machine learning. Two key methods are used to learn the complex mapping between structural details and input NMR spectra, demonstrating excellent accuracy when presented with test sample spectra. This work compares Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), as one step towards the construction of an expert system for solid state materials characterization.},

abstract = {An integrated method for modelingchemical vapor deposition on length scales ranging from microns to meters has been developed. The macroscale problem of flow and transport in a single wafer, low pressurechemical vapor deposition reactor is solved using the finite element method. However, on the feature scale, continuum models of flow and transport are not valid and discrete particle transport models must be employed. The two transport regimes, continuum and discrete particle, are linked by an effective reactivity function $\epsilon$ which includes both effects of multiscale surface heterogeneity and microscale transport resistance. A hybridballistic transport,Monte Carlo method, is developed permitting calculation of $\epsilon$ for any set of reaction pathways occurring over microelectronic device features of any geometry. Surface topography, that is, feature scale calculations, are combined to yield an effective reactivity map over the surface of the substrate. This map is subsequently used to formulate a flux boundary condition on the macroscopic model. Iteration between macroscopic and microscopic models is used to assure a consistent set of conditions at the macro–micro interface. The resulting linked models are used for investigation of local and reactor wide loading effects. Matched macroscopic solutions provide inputs for profile evolution calculations during fill of trenches and vias.},

abstract = {In the quest for higher performance, the dimensions of field-effect transistors (FETs) continue to decrease. However, the reduction in size of FETs comprising 3D semiconductors is limited by the rate at which heat, generated from static power, is dissipated. The increase in static power and the leakage of current between the source and drain electrodes that causes this increase, are referred to as short-channel effects. In FETs with channels made from 2D semiconductors, leakage current is almost eliminated because all electrons are confined in atomically thin channels and, hence, are uniformly influenced by the gate voltage. In this Review, we provide a mathematical framework to evaluate the performance of FETs and describe the challenges for improving the performances of short-channel FETs in relation to the properties of 2D materials, including graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, phosphorene and silicene. We also describe tunnelling FETs that possess extremely low-power switching behaviour and explain how they can be realized using heterostructures of 2D semiconductors.},

abstract = {Layered compounds AMnBi2 (A=Ca, Sr, Ba, or rare earth element) have been established as Dirac materials. Dirac electrons generated by the two-dimensional (2D) Bi square net in these materials are normally massive due to the presence of a spin-orbital coupling (SOC) induced gap at Dirac nodes. Here we report that the Sb square net in an isostructural compound BaMnSb2 can host nearly massless Dirac fermions. We observed strong Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations in this material. From the analyses of the SdH oscillations, we find key signatures of Dirac fermions, including light effective mass ($\sim$0.052m0; m0, mass of free electron), high quantum mobility (1280 cm2V-1S-1) and a Pi Berry phase accumulated along cyclotron orbit. Compared with AMnBi2, BaMnSb2 also exhibits much more significant quasi two-dimensional (2D) electronic structure, with the out-of-plane transport showing nonmetallic conduction below 120K and the ratio of the out-of-plane and in-plane resistivity reaching $\sim$670. Additionally, BaMnSb2 also exhibits an antiferromagnetic order with a weak ferromagnetic component. The combination of nearly massless Dirac fermions on quasi-2D planes with a magnetic order makes BaMnSb2 an intriguing platform for seeking novel exotic phenomena of massless Dirac electrons.},

The contemporary growth of state-of-the-art multifunctional perovskites in the field of light-signal detection has benefited from its outstanding intrinsic optoelectronic properties, including photoinduced polarization, high drift mobilities, and effective charge collection, which are excellent for this application. Photoactive perovskite semiconductors combine effective light absorption, allowing detection of a wide range of electromagnetic waves from ultraviolet and visible, to the near-infrared region, with low-cost solution processability and good photon yield. This class of semiconductor might empower breakthrough photodetector technology in the field of imaging, optical communications, and biomedical sensing. Therefore, here, the focus is specifically on the critical understanding of materials synthesis, design, and engineering for the next-stage development of perovskite photodetectors and highlighting the current challenges in the field, which need to be further studied in the future.},

Controlled growth of such 2D materials with different thickness, composition, and symmetry are of central importance to realize their potential. In particular, the ability to control the symmetry of TMD layers is highly desirable because breaking the inversion symmetry can lead to intriguing valley physics, nonlinear optical properties, and piezoelectric responses. Here we report the first chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of spirals of layered MoS2 with atomically thin helical periodicity, which exhibits a chiral structure and breaks the three-dimensional (3D) inversion symmetry explicitly. The spirals composed of tens of connected MoS2 layers with decreasing areas: each basal plane has a triangular shape and shrinks gradually to the summit when spiraling up. All the layers in the spiral assume an AA lattice stacking, in contrast to the centrosymmetric AB stacking in natural MoS2 crystals. We show that the non-centrosymmetric MoS2 spiral leads to a strong bulk second-order optical nonlinearity. In addition, we found that the growth of spirals involves a dislocation mechanism, which can be generally applicable to other 2D TMD materials.},

We further carry out TEM experiments on single layers of MoS2 at electron voltages in the range of 20–80 kV and demonstrate that indeed there is an additional channel for defect production.

Utilizing high-quality monolayer molybdenum diselenide, we report the unambiguous observation and electrostatic tunability of charging effects in positively charged (X(+)), neutral (X(o)) and negatively charged (X(-)) excitons in field-effect transistors via photoluminescence. The trion charging energy is large (30 meV), enhanced by strong confinement and heavy effective masses, whereas the linewidth is narrow (5 meV) at temperatures <55 K. This is greater spectral contrast than in any known quasi-two-dimensional system. We also find the charging energies for X(+) and X(-) to be nearly identical implying the same effective mass for electrons and holes.},

abstract = {Calculations of ground-state and excited-state properties of materials have been one of the major goals of condensed matter physics. Ground-state properties of solids have been extensively investigated for several decades within the standard density functional theory. Excited-state properties, on the other hand, were relatively unexplored in ab initio calculations until a decade ago. The most suitable approach up to now for studying excited-state properties of extended systems is the Green function method. To calculate the Green function one requires the self-energy operator which is non-local and energy dependent. In this article we describe the GW approximation which has turned out to be a fruitful approximation to the self-energy. The Green function theory, numerical methods for carrying out the self-energy calculations, simplified schemes, and applications to various systems are described. Self-consistency issue and new developments beyond the GW approximation are also discussed as well as the success and shortcomings of the GW approximation.},

abstract = {We investigate the critical methane concentration (CMC) during the atmospheric-pressure chemical vapor deposition (AP-CVD) of graphene on Cu from CH4. Above the CMC, graphene both nucleates and grows; below the CMC, it etches; while at the CMC, carbon intermediate species attach and detach from graphene at equal rates. By studying how the CMC varies with [H2] and temperature, we determine the reaction mechanism and the intermediates. We find that the CMC scales with [H2]3/2 and determine a single Arrhenius temperature dependence close to the expected equilibrium value. For [CH4] > CMC, the radial growth rate is proportional to the “building unit” supersaturation indicating that graphene growth occurs under capture-limited kinetics through an intermediate hydrocarbon that is first-order dependent on [CH4] and proportional to [H2]−3/2. We develop a CH4 decomposition and capture model which is consistent with all measurements indicating that the intermediate is CH. We find that uniform monolayer graphene can only be achieved in AP-CVD near the CMC, with a nucleation density that varies 5 orders of magnitude from 880 to 1075 °C. Thus, our work also provides a roadmap for growing uniform graphene at atmospheric pressure on Cu over a broad range of experimental conditions.},

abstract = {Perovskite solar cells based on organometal halides represent an emerging photovoltaic technology. Perovskite solar cells stem from dye-sensitized solar cells. In a liquid-based dye-sensitized solar cell structure, the adsorption of methylammonium lead halide perovskite on a nanocrystalline TiO2 surface produces a photocurrent with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of around 3–4%, as first discovered in 2009. The PCE was doubled after 2 years by optimizing the perovskite coating conditions. However, the liquid-based perovskite solar cell receives little attention because of its stability issues, including instant dissolution of the perovskite in a liquid electrolyte. A long-term, stable, and high efficiency (∼10%) perovskite solar cell was developed in 2012 by substituting the solid hole conductor with a liquid electrolyte. Efficiencies have quickly risen to 18% in just 2 years. Since PCE values over 20% are realistically anticipated with the use of cheap organometal halide perovskite materials, perovskite solar cells are a promising photovoltaic technology. In this review, the opto-electronic properties of perovskite materials and recent progresses in perovskite solar cells are described. In addition, comments on the issues to current and future challenges are mentioned.},

Their important polymorphs are considered which are for SiO2: $alpha$-quartz, $alpha$- and $beta$-cristobalite and stishovite, for GeO2: $alpha$-quartz, and rutile, for Al2O3: $alpha$-phase, for Si3N4 and Ge3N4: $alpha$- and $beta$-phases. This work constitutes a comprehensive account of both electronic structure and the elastic properties of these important insulating oxides and nitrides obtained with high accuracy based on density functional theory within the local density approximation. Two different norm-conserving \textit{ab initio} pseudopotentials have been tested which agree in all respects with the only exception arising for the elastic properties of rutile GeO2. The agreement with experimental values, when available, are seen to be highly satisfactory. The uniformity and the well convergence of this approach enables an unbiased assessment of important physical parameters within each material and among different insulating oxide and nitrides. The computed static electric susceptibilities are observed to display a strong correlation with their mass densities. There is a marked discrepancy between the considered oxides and nitrides with the latter having sudden increase of density of states away from the respective band edges. This is expected to give rise to excessive carrier scattering which can practically preclude bulk impact ionization process in Si3N4 and Ge3N4.},

Because of the lack of direct and insightful observations, how to control the orientation and the size of two-dimensional material grains is still under debate. Here we discern distinct formation stages for MoS2 flakes from the thermolysis of ammonium thiomolybdates using in situ transmission electron microscopy. In the initial stage (400 degrees C), vertically aligned MoS2 structures grow in a layer-by-layer mode. With the increasing temperature of up to 780 degrees C, the orientation of MoS2 structures becomes horizontal. When the growth temperature reaches 850 degrees C, the crystalline size of MoS2 increases by merging adjacent flakes. Our study shows direct observations of MoS2 growth as the temperature evolves, and sheds light on the controllable orientation and grain size of two-dimensional materials.},

abstract = {A computational method for partitioning a charge density grid into Bader volumes is presented which is efficient, robust, and scales linearly with the number of grid points. The partitioning algorithm follows the steepest ascent paths along the charge density gradient from grid point to grid point until a charge density maximum is reached. In this paper, we describe how accurate off-lattice ascent paths can be represented with respect to the grid points. This improvement maintains the efficient linear scaling of an earlier version of the algorithm, and eliminates a tendency for the Bader surfaces to be aligned along the grid directions. As the algorithm assigns grid points to charge density maxima, subsequent paths are terminated when they reach previously assigned grid points. It is this grid-based approach which gives the algorithm its efficiency, and allows for the analysis of the large grids generated from plane-wave-based density functional theory calculations. {\textcopyright} 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {LiCoO2 in the commercial lithium ion batteries has been suffering from its poor cycling performance at high cutoff voltages. In this study, we employ an atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique to surface-modify a LiCoO2 material with various thickness-controlled metal oxide (TiO2, ZrO2 and Al2O3) coatings to improve its battery performance. The effects of the metal oxide coatings on the electrochemical performance of LiCoO2 electrode are studied in detail. It is demonstrated that a uniform and dense coating via the ALD route on LiCoO2 powder can lower the battery performance due to an obvious decrease in lithium diffusion and electron transport with the coating layers. In contrast, it is revealed that a direct coating on prefabricated LiCoO2 electrodes performs much better than a coating on LiCoO2 powders. It is further disclosed that the improved electrochemical performance of coated LiCoO2 electrode is highly dependent on the coating materials. Of the three coating materials, the Al2O3 coating results in the best cycling stability while the ZrO2 coating contributes to the best rate capability. It is thus suggested that the coating materials are functionally specific, and for the best improvement of a cathode, a particular coating material should be sought.},

abstract = {A general problem of 2 → Nfscattering is addressed with all the states being wave packets with arbitrary phases. Depending on these phases, one deals with coherent states in (3 + 1) D, vortex particles with orbital angular momentum, the Airy beams, and their generalizations. A method is developed in which a number of events represents a functional of the Wigner functions of such states. Using width of a packet $\sigma$p/〈p〉 as a small parameter, the Wigner functions, the number of events, and a cross section are represented as power series in this parameter, the first non-vanishing corrections to their plane-wave expressions are derived, and generalizations for beams are made. Although in this regime the Wigner functions turn out to be everywhere positive, the cross section develops new specifically quantum features, inaccessible in the plane-wave approximation. Among them is dependence on an impact parameter between the beams, on phases of the incoming states, and on a phase of the scattering amplitude. A model-independent analysis of these effects is made. Two ways of measuring how a Coulomb phase and a hadronic one change with a transferred momentum t are discussed.},

Garcia $et$ $al.$, Nature {\bf 460}, 81 (2009)]. Based on first-principles calculations, we show that the system does not polarize unless charged defects or adsorbates form at the surface. We propose electrochemical processes as the most likely origin of this charge. The ferroelectric polarization of the film adapts to the bound charge generated on its surface by redox processes when poling the film. This, in turn, alters the band alignment at the bottom electrode interface, explaining the observed tunneling electroresistance. Our conclusions are supported by energetics calculated for varied electrochemical scenarios.},

abstract = {Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) like molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and tungsten disulfide (WS2) are layered materials capable of growth to one monolayer thickness via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Such CVD methods, while powerful, are notoriously difficult to extend across different reactor types and conditions, with subtle variations often confounding reproducibility, particularly for 2D TMD growth. In this work, we formulate the first generalized TMD synthetic theory by constructing a thermodynamic and kinetic growth mechanism linked to CVD reactor parameters that is predictive of specific geometric shape, size, and aspect ratio from triangular to hexagonal growth, depending on specific CVD reactor conditions. We validate our model using experimental data from Wang et al. (Chem. Mater. 2014, 26, 6371-6379) that demonstrate the systemic evolution of MoS2 morphology down the length of a flow CVD reactor where variations in gas phase concentrations can be accurately estimated using a transport model (CSulfur = 9-965 $\mu$mol/m(3); CMoO3 = 15-16 mmol/m(3)) under otherwise isothermal conditions (700 °C). A stochastic model which utilizes a site-dependent activation energy barrier based on the intrinsic TMD bond energies and a series of Evans-Polanyi relations leads to remarkable, quantitative agreement with both shape and size evolution along the reactor. The model is shown to extend to the growth of WS2 at 800 °C and MoS2 under varied process conditions. Finally, a simplified theory is developed to translate the model into a "kinetic phase diagram" of the growth process. The predictive capability of this model and its extension to other TMD systems promise to significantly increase the controlled synthesis of such materials.},

Semiempirical, and even cer- tain less empirical, ways to do this can be very efficient computationally and have recently been developed to a high level of sophistication, with considerable success. There are, however, effects that are not captured in this way, including surprising dependences of the dispersion energy on the num- ber N of atoms and on separation D. Higher level quantum chemical, perturbative, and random-phase approximation (RPA)-like theories can capture these beyond pairwise effects, but at a high computational cost. Very recent simplified RPA- like approaches based on localized oscillators account for the unusual N dependence in a computationally efficient way. To proceed further, the present work proposes three physically distinct categories of nonpairwise effects (types A, B, and C) against which the performance of existing and future theories can be assessed.},

We show that reasonable agreement with experiment is achieved by assuming a non-spherical escape potential with Ed=(5/3) Esub, where Esub is the sublimation energy. Since field-emission sources and aberration-corrected TEM lenses have become more widespread, sputtering has begun to impose a practical limit to the spatial resolution of microanalysis for some specimens.

Here we report the first demonstration of an atomically thin and atomically sharp heterojunction p-n diode by vertically stacking p-type monolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe2) and n-type few-layer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). Electrical measurement demonstrates excellent diode characteristics with well-defined current rectification behaviour and an ideality factor of 1.2. Photocurrent mapping shows fast photoresponse over the entire overlapping region with a highest external quantum efficiency up to 12 %. Electroluminescence studies show prominent band edge excitonic emission and strikingly enhanced hot electron luminescence. A systematic investigation shows distinct layer-number dependent emission characteristics and reveals important insight about the origin of hot-electron luminescence and the nature of electron-orbital interaction in TMDs. We believe that these atomically thin heterojunction p-n diodes represent an interesting system for probing the fundamental electro-optical properties in TMDs, and can open up a new pathway to novel optoelectronic devices such as atomically thin photodetectors, photovoltaics, as well as spin-/valley-polarized light emitting diodes and on-chip lasers.},

We observe a red-shift in the E′ Raman peak and a less pronounced blue-shift in the A′1 peak with increasing electron dose. Using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and selected-area electron diffraction, we show that irradiation causes partial removal of sulfur and correlate the dependence of the Raman peak shifts with S vacancy density (a few %). This allows us to quantitatively correlate the frequency shifts with vacancy concentration, as rationalized by first-principles density functional theory calculations. In situ device current measurements show an exponential decrease in channel current upon irradiation. Our analysis demonstrates that the observed frequency shifts are intrinsic properties of the defective systems and that Raman spectroscopy can be used as a quantitative diagnostic tool to characterize MoS2-based transport channels.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), most notably, MoS2 and WS2, have attracted significant attention due to their sizable and direct bandgap characteristics. Although several interesting MoS2 and WS2-based optoelectronic devices have been reported, their processability and reproducibility are limited since their electrical properties are strongly dependent of the number of layers, strain and sample sizes. It is highly desirable to have a robust direct bandgap TMD, which is insensitive to those factors. In this work, using density functional theory, we explore the effects of layer number, strain and ribbon width on the electronic properties of ReS2, a new member in the TMD family. The calculation results reveal that for monolayer ReS2, the nature (direct versus indirect) and magnitude of its bandgap are insensitive to strain. Importantly, the predicted bandgap and also charge carrier mobilities are nearly independent of the number of layers. In addition, the direct bandgap of ReS2 nanoribbons is only weakly dependent on their width. These robust characteristics strongly suggest that ReS2 has great potential for applications in optoelectronic nanodevices.},

abstract = {Thickness is one of the fundamental parameters that define the electronic, optical, and thermal properties of two-dimensional (2D) crystals. Phonons in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) were recently found to exhibit unique thickness dependence due to the interplay between short and long range interactions. Here we report Raman spectra of atomically thin sheets of WS2 and WSe2, isoelectronic compounds of MoS2, in the mono- to few-layer thickness regime. We show that, similar to the case of MoS2, the characteristic A1g and E2g(1) modes exhibit stiffening and softening with increasing number of layers, respectively, with a small shift of less than 3 cm(-1) due to large mass of the atoms. Thickness dependence is also observed in a series of multiphonon bands arising from overtone, combination, and zone edge phonons, whose intensity exhibit significant enhancement in excitonic resonance conditions. Some of these multiphonon peaks are found to be absent only in monolayers. These features provide a unique fingerprint and rapid identification for monolayer flakes.},

abstract = {Problems associated with large-scale pattern growth of graphene constitute one of the main obstacles to using this material in device applications. Recently, macroscopic-scale graphene films were prepared by two-dimensional assembly of graphene sheets chemically derived from graphite crystals and graphene oxides. However, the sheet resistance of these films was found to be much larger than theoretically expected values. Here we report the direct synthesis of large-scale graphene films using chemical vapour deposition on thin nickel layers, and present two different methods of patterning the films and transferring them to arbitrary substrates. The transferred graphene films show very low sheet resistance of approximately 280 Omega per square, with approximately 80 per cent optical transparency. At low temperatures, the monolayers transferred to silicon dioxide substrates show electron mobility greater than 3,700 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) and exhibit the half-integer quantum Hall effect, implying that the quality of graphene grown by chemical vapour deposition is as high as mechanically cleaved graphene. Employing the outstanding mechanical properties of graphene, we also demonstrate the macroscopic use of these highly conducting and transparent electrodes in flexible, stretchable, foldable electronics.},

However, each code implements the formalism in a different way, raising questions about the reproducibility of such predictions. We report the results of a community-wide effort that compared 15 solid-state codes, using 40 different potentials or basis set types, to assess the quality of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof equations of state for 71 elemental crystals. We conclude that predictions from recent codes and pseudopotentials agree very well, with pairwise differences that are comparable to those between different high-precision experiments. Older methods, however, have less precise agreement. Our benchmark provides a framework for users and developers to document the precision of new applications and methodological improvements.},

abstract = {MoS2 single layers have recently emerged as strong competitors of graphene in electronic and optoelectronic device applications due to their intrinsic direct bandgap. However, transport measurements reveal the crucial role of defect-induced electronic states, pointing out the fundamental importance of characterizing their intrinsic defect structure. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) is able to image atomic scale defects in MoS2 single layers, but the imaged defect structure is far from the one probed in the electronic devices, as the defect density and distribution are substantially altered during the TEM imaging. Here, we report that under special imaging conditions, STM measurements can fully resolve the native atomic scale defect structure of MoS2 single layers. Our STM investigations clearly resolve a high intrinsic concentration of individual sulfur atom vacancies, and experimentally identify the nature of the defect induced electronic mid-gap states, by combining topographic STM images with ab intio calculations. Experimental data on the intrinsic defect structure and the associated defect-bound electronic states that can be directly used for the interpretation of transport measurements are essential to fully understand the operation, reliability and performance limitations of realistic electronic devices based on MoS2 single layers.},

@article{Senftle2016,
abstract = {The reactive force-ﬁeld (ReaxFF) interatomic potential is a powerful computational tool for exploring, developing and optimizing material properties. Methods based on the principles of quantum mechanics (QM), while offering valuable theoretical guidance at the electronic level, are often too computationally intense for simulations that consider the full dynamic evolution of a system. Alternatively, empirical interatomic potentials that are based on classical principles require signiﬁcantly fewer computational resources, which enables simulations to better describe dynamic processes over longer timeframes and on larger scales. Such methods, however, typically require a predeﬁned connectivity between atoms, precluding simulations that involve reactive events. The ReaxFF method was developed to help bridge this gap. Approaching the gap from the classical side, ReaxFF casts the empirical interatomic potential within a bond-order formalism, thus implicitly describing chemical bonding without expensive QM calculations. This article provides an overview of the development, application, and future directions of the ReaxFF method.},

The defects, which are inherently related to the crystal symmetry of transition metal dichalcogenides, can expand through sequential bond rotations, as evident from in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy experiments, and eventually form larger linear defects consisting of aligned 8-5-5-8 membered rings. First-principles calculations provide insights into the evolution of rotational defects and show that they give rise to p-type doping and local magnetic moments, but weakly affect mechanical characteristics of transition metal dichalcogenides.

To pursue ultimate performance, precisely controlled doping engineering of 2D MXs is desired for tailoring their physical and chemical properties in functional devices. In this review, we highlight the recent progress in the doping engineering of 2D MXs, covering that enabled by substitution, exterior charge transfer, intercalation and the electrostatic doping mechanism. A variety of novel doping engineering examples leading to Janus structures, defect curing effects, zero-valent intercalation and deliberately devised floating gate modulation will be discussed together with their intriguing application prospects. The choice of doping strategies and sources for functionalizing MXs will be provided to facilitate ongoing research in this field toward multifunctional applications.},

abstract = {We develop here the methodology for dramatically accelerating the ReaxFF reactive force field based reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) simulations through use of the bond boost concept (BB), which we validate here for describing hydrogen combustion. The bond order, undercoordination, and overcoordination concepts of ReaxFF ensure that the BB correctly adapts to the instantaneous configurations in the reactive system to automatically identify the reactions appropriate to receive the bond boost. We refer to this as adaptive Accelerated ReaxFF Reactive Dynamics or aARRDyn. To validate the aARRDyn methodology, we determined the detailed sequence of reactions for hydrogen combustion with and without the BB. We validate that the kinetics and reaction mechanisms (that is the detailed sequences of reactive intermediates and their subsequent transformation to others) for H2 oxidation obtained from aARRDyn agrees well with the brute force reactive molecular dynamics (BF-RMD) at 2498 K. Using aARRDyn, we then extend our simulations to the whole range of combustion temperatures from ignition (798 K) to flame temperature (2998K), and demonstrate that, over this full temperature range, the reaction rates predicted by aARRDyn agree well with the BF-RMD values, extrapolated to lower temperatures. For the aARRDyn simulation at 798 K we find that the time period for half the H2 to form H2O product is ∼538 s, whereas the computational cost was just 1289 ps, a speed increase of ∼0.42 trillion (10(12)) over BF-RMD. In carrying out these RMD simulations we found that the ReaxFF-COH2008 version of the ReaxFF force field was not accurate for such intermediates as H3O. Consequently we reoptimized the fit to a quantum mechanics (QM) level, leading to the ReaxFF-OH2014 force field that was used in the simulations.},

Native defects such as a S vacancy (V-S), a S interstitial (S-i), a Mo vacancy (V-Mo), and a Mo interstitial (Mo-i) are considered. The S-i is found to have S-adatom configuration on top of a host S atom, and the Mo-i has Mo-Mo-i split interstitial configuration along the c direction. The formation energies of the native defects in neutral and charged states are calculated. For the charged states, the artificial electrostatic interactions between image charges in supercells are eliminated by a supercell size scaling scheme and a correction scheme that uses a Gaussian model charge. It is found that the V-S has a low formation energy of 1.3-1.5 eV in the Mo-rich limit condition, and the S-i has 1.0 eV in the S-rich limit condition. The V-S is found to be a deep single acceptor with the (0/-) transition level at 1.7 eV above the valence-band maximum (VBM). The S-i is found to be an electrically neutral defect. The Mo-related native defects of V-Mo and Mo-i are found to be high in formation energy above 4 eV. The V-Mo is a deep single acceptor and the Mo-i is a deep single donor, of which the (0/-) acceptor and (+/0) donor transition levels are found at 1.1 and 0.3 eV above the VBM, respectively.},

In the current generation of transistors, the transistor dimensions have shrunk to such an extent that the electrical characteristics of the device can be markedly degraded, making it unlikely that the exponential decrease in transistor size can continue. Recently, however, a new generation of MOSFETs, called multigate transistors, has emerged, and this multigate geometry will allow the continuing enhancement of computer performance into the next decade.},

For the three excitation wavelengths used in this study, the frequency of the A(1g)($\Gamma$) phonon mode monotonically decreases with the number of layers. For single-layer WS2, the 514.5 nm laser excitation generates a second-order Raman resonance involving the longitudinal acoustic mode (LA(M)). This resonance results from a coupling between the electronic band structure and lattice vibrations. First-principles calculations were used to determine the electronic and phonon band structures of single-layer and bulk WS2. The reduced intensity of the 2LA mode was then computed, as a function of the laser wavelength, from the fourth-order Fermi golden rule. Our observations establish an unambiguous and nondestructive Raman fingerprint for identifying single- and few-layered WS2 films.},

This leads to a seamless description of polarization and depolarization for the polarizability tensor of molecules and solids. The screened long-range many-body vdW energy is obtained from the solution of the Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation for a system of coupled oscillators. We show that the screening and the many-body vdW energy play a significant role even for rather small molecules, becoming crucial for an accurate treatment of conformational energies for biomolecules and binding of molecular crystals.

abstract = {The relativistic S-matrix formalism of Feynman is applied to the bound-state problem for two interacting Fermi-Dirac particles. The bound state is described by a wave function depending on separate times for each of the two particles. Two alternative integral equations for this wave function are derived with kernels in the form of an expansion in powers of g2, the dimensionless coupling constant for the interaction. Each term in these expansions gives Lorentz-invariant equations. The validity and physical significance of these equations is discussed. In extreme nonrelativistic approximation and to lowest order in g2 they reduce to the appropriate Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation. One of these integral equations is applied to the deuteron ground state using scalar mesons of mass $\mu$ with scalar coupling. For neutral mesons the Lorentz-invariant interaction is transformed into the sum of the instantaneous Yukawa interaction and a retarded correction term. The value obtained for g2 differs only by a fraction proportional to ($\mu$M)2 from that obtained by using a phenomenological Yukawa potential. For a purely charged meson theory a correction term is obtained by a direct solution of the relativistic integral equation using only the first term in the expansion of the kernel. This correction is due to the fact that a nucleon can emit, or absorb, positive and negative mesons only alternately. The constant g2 is increased by a fraction of 1.1($\mu$M) or 15 percent. {\textcopyright} 1951 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The effects of depositing ultrathin (<1 nm) Al2O3 coatings on LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) particles using atomic layer deposition (ALD) are presented. Promising electrochemical performance of the Al2O3 ALD coated LNMO at 30 °C is demonstrated in not only significantly improved coulombic efficiency, cycle retention, and rate capability, but also in dramatically suppressed self-discharge and dissolution of transition metals. Combined analyses by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and ex-situ time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry reveal that the solid electrolyte interphase layer on the Al2O3 ALD coated LNMO is much thinner and contains fewer organic species than the one on the bare LNMO. This difference originates from the suppression of the side reaction at high voltage by the Al2O3 ALD protective coating. Also, fluorination of Al2O3 ALD layer upon repeated charge–discharge cycling is confirmed, and this can account for the capacity increases during the initial charge–discharge cycles. Finally, it is also demonstrated that a full LNMO/Li4Ti5O12 battery incorporating the Al2O3 ALD coated LNMO outperforms the one incorporating only bare LNMO.},

Two Raman modes, E(1)(2g) and A(1g), exhibited sensitive thickness dependence, with the frequency of the former decreasing and that of the latter increasing with thickness. The results provide a convenient and reliable means for determining layer thickness with atomic-level precision. The opposite direction of the frequency shifts, which cannot be explained solely by van der Waals interlayer coupling, is attributed to Coulombic interactions and possible stacking-induced changes of the intralayer bonding.

In a good conductor such as graphene, the damage is limited to the knock-on process caused by elastic electron-nucleus scattering. This process is determined by the kinetic energy an atom needs to be sputtered, i.e. its displacement threshold energy Ed. This is typically assumed to have a fixed value for all electron impacts on equivalent atoms within a crystal. Here we show using density functional tight-binding simulations that the displacement threshold energy is affected by thermal perturbations of atoms from their equilibrium positions. This effect can be accounted for in the estimation of the displacement cross section by replacing the constant threshold energy value with a distribution. Our refined model better describes previous precision measurements of graphene knock-on damage, and should be considered also for other low-dimensional materials.},

abstract = {In this work, we propose a new configuration of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor that is based on graphene–MoS2 hybrid structures for ultrasensitive detection of molecules. The proposed system displays a phase-sensitivity enhancement factor of more than 500-fold when compared to the SPR sensing scheme without the graphene–MoS2 coating or with only graphene coating. Our hypothesis is that the monolayer MoS2 has a much higher optical absorption efficiency (∼5%) than that of the graphene layer (∼2.3%). Based on our findings, the electron energy loss of MoS2 layer is comparable to that of graphene and this will allow a successful (∼100%) of light energy transfer to the graphene–MoS2 coated sensing substrate. Such process will lead to a significant enhancement of SPR signals. Our simulation shows that a quasi-dark point of the reflected light can be achieved under this condition and this has resulted in a steep phase jump at the resonance angle of our newly proposed SPR system. More importantly, we found that phase interrogation detection approach of the graphene–MoS2 hybrid structures-based sensing system is more sensitive than that of using the regularly angular interrogation method and our theoretical analysis indicates that 45nm of Au film thickness and 3 coating layers of MoS2 nanosheet are the optimized parameters needed for the proposed SPR system to achieve the highest detection sensitivity range.},

The reader is first introduced to the basic mechanisms of radiation effects in solids with particular emphasis on atom displacements by knock-on collisions. The influence ofvarious parametersonthe displacement cross sections of carbon atoms is discussed. The types of irradiation-induced defects and their migration are described as well as ordering phenomena which are observable under the non-equilibrium conditions of irradiation. The main part of this reviewdeals with alterations of carbon nanostructures by the electron beam in an electron microscope. This type of experiment is of paramount importance because it allows in situ observation of dynamic processes on an atomic scale. In the second part, radiation effects in the modifications of elemental carbon, in particular in graphite which forms the crystallographic basis of most carbon nanostructures, are treated in detail. It follows a review of the available experimental results on radiation defects in carbon nanostructures such as fullerenes, nanotubes and carbon onions. Finally, the phenomena of structure formation under irradiation, in particular the self-assembling of spherical carbon onions and the irradiation- induced transformation of graphitic nanoparticles into diamond, are presented and discussed qualitatively in the context of non-equilibrium structure formation.},

For example, in some cases when the bulk material is exfoliated down to a monolayer, an indirect-to-direct band gap in the visible range is observed. The number of layers $N$ ($N$ even or odd) drives changes in space group symmetry that are reflected in the optical properties. The understanding of the space group symmetry as a function of the number of layers is therefore important for the correct interpretation of the experimental data. Here we present a thorough group theory study of the symmetry aspects relevant to optical and spectroscopic analysis, for the most common polytypes of TMDCs, i.e. $2Ha$, $2Hc$ and $1T$, as a function of the number of layers. Real space symmetries, the group of the wave vectors, the relevance of inversion symmetry, irreducible representations of the vibrational modes, optical selection rules and Raman tensors are discussed.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) materials are at the heart of many novel devices due to their unique and often superior properties. For simplicity, 2D materials are often assumed to exist in their text-book form, i.e., as an ideal solid with no imperfections. However, defects are ubiquitous in macroscopic samples and play an important - if not imperative - role for the performance of any device. Thus, many independent studies have targeted the artificial introduction of defects into 2D materials by particle irradiation. In our view it would be beneficial to develop general defect engineering strategies for 2D materials based on a thorough understanding of the defect creation mechanisms, which may significantly vary from the ones relevant for 3D materials. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in defect engineering of 2D materials by electron and ion irradiation with a clear focus on defect creation on the atomic scale and by individual impacts. Whenever possible we compile reported experimental data alongside corresponding theoretical studies. We show that, on the one hand, defect engineering by particle irradiation covers a wide range of defect types that can be fabricated with great precision in the most commonly investigated 2D materials. On the other hand, gaining a complete understanding still remains a challenge, that can be met by combining advanced theoretical methods and improved experimental set-ups, both of which only now begin to emerge. In conjunction with novel 2D materials, this challenge promises attractive future opportunities for researchers in this field.},

We find a large number of narrow valence bands, which we attribute to the combined influence of the structural distortion and spin-orbit coupling. We further image how this leads to a strong in-plane anisotropy of the electronic structure, with quasi-one-dimensional bands reflecting predominant hopping along zig-zag Re chains. We find that this does not persist up to the top of the valence band, where a more three-dimensional character is recovered with the fundamental band gap located away from the Brillouin zone centre along $k_z$. These experiments are in good agreement with our density-functional theory calculations, shedding new light on the bulk electronic structure of ReS$_2$, and how it can be expected to evolve when thinned to a single layer.},

Subsequently, the Ed values estimated for B, N and H atoms were used for predicting the knock-on cross section for these atoms against electron irradiation. The results show that in most of the cases the displacement threshold value deteriorates with hydrogenation. The redistribution of charge among different atoms with the increase in B-N bond length plays a significant role in deciding the displacement thresholds for B and N atoms. It was predicted with the help of obtained Ed values that in a lower energy range the H atoms have a higher knock-on cross-section than B and N atoms against electron irradiation. The results from this study lead the authors to recommend cautious use of transmission electron microscopy for the characterization of hydrogenated h-BN nanosheets.},

abstract = {Successful doping of single layer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) remains a formidable barrier to their incorporation into a range of technologies. We use density functional theory within the generalized gradient approximation to assess the possibility of substitutional doping the metal and chalcogen sites in molybdenum and tungsten disulfide as well as diselenide against a large fraction of the periodic table. An automated analysis of the energetics, atomic and electronic structure of thousands of calculations results in insightful trends across the periodic table and points out promising dopants to be pursued experimentally. The automated analysis of the electronic structure is able to capture and graphically represent subtleties in the electronic structure of doped TMDs including the presence of gap states and the results are in good agreement with the limited experimental data available. Beyond previously studied cases, our predictions suggest promising candidates for p-type doping and reveal interesting physics behind the doping of the metal site. Doping with early transition metals (TMs) leads to tensile strain and a significant reduction in the bandgap. The bandgap increases and strain is reduced as the d-states are filled into the mid TMs; these trends reverse are we move into the late TMs. Thus, strain and bandgaps are dominated by the non-monotonous variation in atomic radius of the series. Additionally, the Fermi energy increases monotonously as the d-shell is filled from the early to mid TMs and we observe few to no gap states indicating the possibility of both n- (early TMs) and p- (mid TMs) type doping.},

Isolated monolayers show changes in electronic structure and lattice vibration energies, including a transition from indirect to direct bandgap. Here we present a new member of the family, rhenium disulphide (ReS2), where such variation is absent and bulk behaves as electronically and vibrationally decoupled monolayers stacked together. From bulk to monolayers, ReS2 remains direct bandgap and its Raman spectrum shows no dependence on the number of layers. Interlayer decoupling is further demonstrated by the insensitivity of the optical absorption and Raman spectrum to interlayer distance modulated by hydrostatic pressure. Theoretical calculations attribute the decoupling to Peierls distortion of the 1T structure of ReS2, which prevents ordered stacking and minimizes the interlayer overlap of wavefunctions. Such vanishing interlayer coupling enables probing of two-dimensional-like systems without the need for monolayers.},

abstract = {Here, we present a temperature (T) dependent comparison between field-effect and Hall mobilities in field-effect transistors based on few-layered WSe2 exfoliated onto SiO2. Without dielectric engineering and beyond a T-dependent threshold gate-voltage, we observe maximum hole mobilities approaching 350 cm(2)/Vs at T = 300 K. The hole Hall mobility reaches a maximum value of 650 cm(2)/Vs as T is lowered below $\sim$150 K, indicating that insofar WSe2-based field-effect transistors (FETs) display the largest Hall mobilities among the transition metal dichalcogenides. The gate capacitance, as extracted from the Hall-effect, reveals the presence of spurious charges in the channel, while the two-terminal sheet resistivity displays two-dimensional variable-range hopping behavior, indicating carrier localization induced by disorder at the interface between WSe2 and SiO2. We argue that improvements in the fabrication protocols as, for example, the use of a substrate free of dangling bonds are likely to produce WSe2-based FETs displaying higher room temperature mobilities, i.e. approaching those of p-doped Si, which would make it a suitable candidate for high performance opto-electronics.},

Bulk MoS(2), a prototypical metal dichalcogenide, is an indirect bandgap semiconductor with negligible photoluminescence. When the MoS(2) crystal is thinned to monolayer, however, a strong photoluminescence emerges, indicating an indirect to direct bandgap transition in this d-electron system.

abstract = {Inspired by the intensive studies of graphene, scientists have put extraordinary efforts in exploring properties and phenomena involving noncarbon graphene-like two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials, particularly those only consisting of single layers or few layers. Experimentally, many graphene-like 2D structures have been fabricated from a large variety of layered and nonlayered materials. These graphene-like structures have already shown exceptional properties, which will offer new breakthroughs and innovative opportunities in nanomaterials science. Theoretically, density-functional theory (DFT) computations offer a powerful tool to investigate the electronic structure (principally the ground state) of nanomaterials, to predict their intrinsic properties, assist in characterization, and rationalization of experimental findings, as well as explore their potential applications. By DFT computations, many graphene-like materials have been explored and designed, and fantastic properties are disclosed. In this review, we present the recent computational progress in discovering the intrinsic structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of several important and representative graphene-like 2D nanomaterials, as well as identifying their potential applications. The highlighted graphene-like structures include layered van der Waals (vdW) materials (h-BN, MoS2, -MoO3, and V2O5), graphitic-like ZnO, MXenes (metal carbides or carbonitrides), the not-yet-synthesized B2C, SiC2, BSi3, arsenene and antimonene, and single-layer coordination polymers ([Cu2Br(IN)(2)](n) (IN = isonicotinato), Fe-phthalocyanine, and nickel bis(dithiolene)).

The search yielded 826 stable layered materials, which are considered as candidates for the formation of two-dimensional monolayers via exfoliation. Density-functional theory calculates the exfoliation energy of each material and 681 monolayers are found to exhibit exfoliation energies below those of certain already-extant two-dimensional materials, indicating the possibility of exfoliating them from bulk phases. The crystal structures of these two-dimensional materials provide templates for future theoretical searches of stable two-dimensional materials.

More recently, heterostructures have also been obtained by vertical stacking of two-dimensional crystals, such as graphene and related two-dimensional materials. These layered designer materials are held together by van der Waals forces and contain atomically sharp interfaces. Here, we report on a type-II van der Waals heterojunction made of molybdenum disulfide and tungsten diselenide monolayers. The junction is electrically tunable, and under appropriate gate bias an atomically thin diode is realized. Upon optical illumination, charge transfer occurs across the planar interface and the device exhibits a photovoltaic effect. Advances in large-scale production of two-dimensional crystals could thus lead to a new photovoltaic solar technology.},

Meanwhile, they are extremely bendable, promising for applications in flexible electronics. However, the synthetic approach to obtain large-area MoS2 atomic thin layers is still lacking. Here we report that wafer-scale MoS2 thin layers can be obtained using MoO3 thin films as a starting material followed by a two-step thermal process, reduction of MoO3 at 500 °C in hydrogen and sulfurization at 1000 °C in the presence of sulfur. Spectroscopic, optical and electrical characterizations reveal that these films are polycrystalline and with semiconductor properties. The obtained MoS2 films are uniform in thickness and easily transferable to arbitrary substrates, which make such films suitable for flexible electronics or optoelectronics.},

We control the accuracy of the resulting pseudopotentials on a test set of materials independent of the training set.

abstract = {Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides consist of monolayers held together by weak forces where the layers are electronically and vibrationally coupled. Isolated monolayers show changes in electronic structure and lattice vibration energies, including a transition from indirect to direct bandgap. Here we present a new member of the family, rhenium disulphide (ReS2), where such variation is absent and bulk behaves as electronically and vibrationally decoupled monolayers stacked together. From bulk to monolayers, ReS2 remains direct bandgap and its Raman spectrum shows no dependence on the number of layers. Interlayer decoupling is further demonstrated by the insensitivity of the optical absorption and Raman spectrum to interlayer distance modulated by hydrostatic pressure. Theoretical calculations attribute the decoupling to Peierls distortion of the 1T structure of ReS2, which prevents ordered stacking and minimizes the interlayer overlap of wavefunctions. Such vanishing interlayer coupling enables probing of two-dimensional-like systems without the need for monolayers.},

This time-dependent density is determined by solving an auxiliary set of noninteracting Schr¨odinger equa- tions, the Kohn-Sham equations. The nontrivial part of the many-body interaction is contained in the so-called exchange-correlation potential, for which reasonably good approximations exist. Within TDDFT two regimes can be distinguished: (a)Ifthe external time-dependent potential is “small,” the complete numerical solution of the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equations can be avoided by the use of linear response theory. This is the case, e.g., for the calculation of photoabsorption spectra. (b)For a “strong” external potential, a full solution of the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equa- tions is in order. This situation is encountered, for instance, when matter interacts with intense laser fields. In this review we give an overview ofTDDFT from its theoretical foundations to several applications both in the linear and in the nonlinear regime.},

We create van der Waals heterostructures formed by an ultrathin ferromagnetic semiconductor CrI3 and a monolayer of WSe2. We observe unprecedented control of the spin and valley pseudospin in WSe2, where we detect a large magnetic exchange field of nearly 13 T and rapid switching of the WSe2 valley splitting and polarization via flipping of the CrI3 magnetization. The WSe2 photoluminescence intensity strongly depends on the relative alignment between photoexcited spins in WSe2 and the CrI3 magnetization, because of ultrafast spin-dependent charge hopping across the heterostructure interface. The photoluminescence detection of valley pseudospin provides a simple and sensitive method to probe the intriguing domain dynamics in the ultrathin magnet, as well as the rich spin interactions within the heterostructure.},

For a representative structure of MoS2, we carry out high-resolution transmission electron microscopy experiments and validate our theoretical predictions via observations of vacancy formation under exposure to an 80 keV electron beam. We further show that TMDs can be doped by filling the vacancies created by the electron beam with impurity atoms. Thereby, our results not only shed light on the radiation response of a system with reduced dimensionality, but also suggest new ways for engineering the electronic structure of TMDs.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional crystals of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides absorb a large fraction of incident photons in the visible frequencies despite being atomically thin. It has been suggested that the strong absorption is due to the parallel band or ‘band nesting' effect and corresponding divergence in the joint density of states. Here, we use photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy to show that the band nesting in mono- and bilayer MX2 (M=Mo, W and X=S, Se) results in excitation-dependent characteristic relaxation pathways of the photoexcited carriers. Our experimental and simulation results reveal that photoexcited electron–hole pairs in the nesting region spontaneously separate in k-space, relaxing towards immediate band extrema with opposite momentum. These effects imply that the loss of photocarriers due to direct exciton recombination is temporarily suppressed for excitation in resonance with band nesting. Our findings highlight the potential for efficient hot carrier collection using these materials as the absorbers in optoelectronic devices.},

The data is then quantified, allowing insight into the defect formation mechanism, which is discussed in comparison with the potential candidate damage processes. We show that the defect shapes are determined by an interplay between electron damage, which we assign to charging, and thermal effects.

In the first approach to answering this question, we examine the step-wise increase in saturation of a one-dimensional stack of benzene molecules by enumerating the partially saturated polymer intermediates, subject to constraints of unit cell size and energy. Defining the number of four-coordinate carbon atoms per benzene formula unit as the degree of saturation, a set of isomers for degree-two and degree-four polymers can be generated by either thinking of the propagation of partially saturated building blocks, or by considering a sequence of cycloadditions. There is also one 4+2 reaction sequence that jumps directly from a benzene stack to a degree-four polymer. The set of degree-two polymers provides several useful signposts towards achieving full saturation: chiral versus achiral building blocks, certain forms of conformational freedom, and also dead ends to further saturation. These insights allow us to generate a larger set of degree-four polymers and enumerate the many pathways that lead from benzene stacks to completely saturated carbon nanothreads.},

The morphology of 2D materials is known vary depending on experimental conditions. For the case of MoS 2 , the morphology has been shown to vary from rounded (molybdenum rich) domains to equilateral triangular (sulfur rich) domains. These different morphologies can result in drastically different properties, which can be exploited for applications in catalytic reactions, digital electronics, optoelectronics, and energy storage. Powder vaporization (PV) synthesis of molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) can yield vertical domains, however, these domains are often ignored when the morphology evolution of MoS 2 is discussed, thereby completely omitting a major part of the impact of the Mo:S ratio to the growth mode of MoS 2 during PV. Combining experimental and numerical simulation methods, we reveal a vertical-to-horizontal growth mode transition for MoS 2 that occurs in the presence of a molybdenum oxide partial pressure gradient. Transmission electron microscopy reveals that the growth of vertical MoS 2 results from initial seeding of single crystalline molybdenum dioxide, followed by sulfurization from the substrate upward to form vertically oriented MoS 2 domains.},

abstract = {In this work, we developed an interatomic potential for saturated hydrocarbons using the modified embedded-atom method (MEAM), a reactive semi-empirical many-body potential based on density functional theory and pair potentials. We parameterized the potential by fitting to a large experimental and first-principles (FP) database consisting of (1) bond distances, bond angles, and atomization energies at 0 K of a homologous series of alkanes and their select isomers from methane to n-octane, (2) the potential energy curves of H2, CH, and C2 diatomics, (3) the potential energy curves of hydrogen, methane, ethane, and propane dimers, i.e., (H2)2, (CH4)2, (C2H6)2, and (C3H8)2, respectively, and (4) pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) data of a dense high-pressure methane system with the density of 0.5534 g cc(-1). We compared the atomization energies and geometries of a range of linear alkanes, cycloalkanes, and free radicals calculated from the MEAM potential to those calculated by other commonly used reactive potentials for hydrocarbons, i.e., second-generation reactive empirical bond order (REBO) and reactive force field (ReaxFF). MEAM reproduced the experimental and/or FP data with accuracy comparable to or better than REBO or ReaxFF. The experimental PVT data for a relatively large series of methane, ethane, propane, and butane systems with different densities were predicted reasonably well by the MEAM potential. Although the MEAM formalism has been applied to atomic systems with predominantly metallic bonding in the past, the current work demonstrates the promising extension of the MEAM potential to covalently bonded molecular systems, specifically saturated hydrocarbons and saturated hydrocarbon-based polymers. The MEAM potential has already been parameterized for a large number of metallic unary, binary, ternary, carbide, nitride, and hydride systems, and extending it to saturated hydrocarbons provides a reliable and transferable potential for atomistic/molecular studies of complex material phenomena involving hydrocarbon-metal or polymer-metal interfaces, polymer-metal nanocomposites, fracture and failure in hydrocarbon-based polymers, etc. The latter is especially true since MEAM is a reactive potential that allows for dynamic bond formation and bond breaking during simulation. Our results show that MEAM predicts the energetics of two major chemical reactions for saturated hydrocarbons, i.e., breaking a C-C and a C-H bond, reasonably well. However, the current parameterization does not accurately reproduce the energetics and structures of unsaturated hydrocarbons and, therefore, should not be applied to such systems.},

The initial studies have shown promising performance, including a high on/off current ratio and carrier mobility with a high-$\kappa$ gate dielectric. However, the performance of these devices strongly depends on the crystalline quality and defect morphology of the monolayers. In order to obtain a detailed understanding of the MoS2 electronic device properties, we examine possible defect structures and their impact on the MoS2 monolayer electronic properties, using density functional theory in combination with scanning tunneling microscopy to identify the nature of the most likely defects. Quantitative understanding based on a detailed knowledge of the atomic and electronic structures will facilitate the search of suitable defect passivation techniques. Our results show that S adatoms are the most energetically favorable type of defect and that S vacancies are energetically more favorable than Mo vacancies. This approach may be extended to other transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), thus providing useful insights to optimize TMD-based electronic devices.},

Using this potential, we perform classical molecular dynamics simulations to study chirality, size, and strain effects on the Young's modulus and the thermal conductivity of SLMoS2. We demonstrate the importance of the free edges on the mechanical and thermal properties of SLMoS2 nanoribbons. Specifically, while edge effects are found to reduce the Young's modulus of SLMoS2 nanoribbons, the free edges also reduce the thermal stability of SLMoS2 nanoribbons, which may induce melting well below the bulk melt temperature. Finally, uniaxial strain is found to efficiently manipulate the thermal conductivity of infinite, periodic SLMoS2.},

This is anticipated to be vastly different for 2D anisotropic materials like ReS 2 mainly due to large anisotropy in interfacial energy imposed by its distorted 1T crystal structure and formation of signature Re-chains along [010] b-axis direction. Here, we provide first insight on domain architecture on chemical vapor deposited (CVD) ReS 2 domains using high-resolution scanning transmission electron micros-copy, angle-resolved nano-Raman spectroscopy, reflectivity, and atomic force microscopy measurements. Results provide ways to achieve crystalline anisotropy in CVD ReS 2 , establish domain architecture of high symmetry ReS 2 flakes, and determine Re-chain orientation within subdomains. Results also provide a first atomic resolution look at ReS 2 GBs, and surprisingly we find that cluster and vacancy defects, formed by collusion of Re-chains at the GBs, dramatically impact the crystal structure by changing the Re-chain direction and rotating Re-chains 180° along their b-axis.

abstract = {We report here the field emission studies of a layered WS2-RGO composite at the base pressure of $\sim$1 × 10(-8) mbar. The turn on field required to draw a field emission current density of 1 $\mu$A/cm(2) is found to be 3.5, 2.3 and 2 V/$\mu$m for WS2, RGO and the WS2-RGO composite respectively. The enhanced field emission behavior observed for the WS2-RGO nanocomposite is attributed to a high field enhancement factor of 2978, which is associated with the surface protrusions of the single-to-few layer thick sheets of the nanocomposite. The highest current density of $\sim$800 $\mu$A/cm(2) is drawn at an applied field of 4.1 V/$\mu$m from a few layers of the WS2-RGO nanocomposite. Furthermore, first-principles density functional calculations suggest that the enhanced field emission may also be due to an overalp of the electronic structures of WS2 and RGO, where graphene-like states are dumped in the region of the WS2 fundamental gap.},

We use Raman spectroscopy and first-principles theory to report our findings related to low-frequency (LF) interlayer breathing modes (<100 cm-1) in few-layer BP for the first time. The breathing modes are assigned to Ag symmetry by the laser polarization dependence study and group theory analysis. Compared to the high-frequency (HF) Raman modes, the LF breathing modes are much more sensitive to interlayer coupling and thus their frequencies show much stronger dependence on the number of layers. Hence, they could be used as effective means to probe both the crystalline orientation and thickness for few-layer BP. Furthermore, the temperature dependence study shows that the breathing modes have a harmonic behavior, in contrast to HF Raman modes which are known to exhibit anharmonicity.},

abstract = {Semiconductor p-n junctions are essential building blocks for modern electronics and optoelectronics. In conventional semiconductors, a p-n junction produces depletion regions of free charge carriers at equilibrium and built-in potentials associated with uncompensated dopant atoms. Carrier transport across the junction occurs by diffusion and drift processes defined by the spatial extent of this region. With the advent of atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) materials and their heterostructures, we are now able to realize a p-n junction at the ultimate quantum limit. In particular, vdW junctions composed of p- and n-type semiconductors each just one unit cell thick are predicted to exhibit completely different charge transport characteristics than bulk junctions. Here we report the electronic and optoelectronic characterization of atomically thin p-n heterojunctions fabricated using vdW assembly of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Across the p-n interface, we observe gate-tuneable diode-like current rectification and photovoltaic response. We find that the tunnelling-assisted interlayer recombination of the majority carriers is responsible for the tunability of the electronic and optoelectronic processes. Sandwiching an atomic p-n junction between graphene layers enhances collection of the photoexcited carriers. The atomically scaled vdW p-n heterostructures presented here constitute the ultimate quantum limit for functional electronic and optoelectronic components.},

Our results show that the presence of a single edge vacancy, with a missing MoS2/WSe2 triplet, is enough to suppress the conductance of the system by almost one half for most energies around the Fermi level. Furthermore, the presence of other single defects along the same edge has little effect on the overall conductance, indicating that the conductance of that particular edge has been strongly suppressed by the first defect. The presence of another defect on the opposite edge further suppresses the quantum conductance, independently of the relative position between the two defects in opposite edges. The introduction of other defects cause the suppression to be energy dependent, leading to conductance peaks which depend on the geometry of the edges. The strong conductance dependence on the presence of edge defects is corroborated by DFT calculations using SIESTA, which show that the electronic bands near the Fermi energy are strongly localized at the edge.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim. Rhenium disulfide (ReS 2 ) differs fundamentally from other group-VI transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) due to its low structural symmetry, which results in its optical and electrical anisotropy. Although vertical growth is observed in some TMDs under special growth conditions, vertical growth in ReS 2 is very different in that it is highly spontaneous and substrate-independent. In this study, the mechanism that underpins the thermodynamically favorable vertical growth mode of ReS 2 is uncovered. It is found that the governing mechanism for ReS 2 growth involves two distinct stages. In the first stage, ReS 2 grows parallel to the growth substrate, consistent with conventional TMD growth. However, subsequent vertical growth is nucleated at points on the lattice where Re atoms are "pinched" together. At such sites, an additional Re atom binds with the cluster of pinched Re atoms, leaving an under-coordinated S atom protruding out of the ReS 2 plane. This under-coordinated S is "reactive" and binds to free Re and S atoms, initiating growth in a direction perpendicular to the ReS 2 surface. The utility of such vertical ReS 2 arrays in applications where high surface-to-volume ratio and electric-field enhancement are essential, such as surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy, field emission, and solar-based disinfection of bacteria, is demonstrated.},

However, energy transferred from the e-beam can also provide a way to modify 2D materials via defect engineering when the interaction of the beam with the sample is precisely controlled. In this article, we discuss the atomic geometry, formation mechanism, and properties of several types of structural defects, ranging from zero-dimensional point defects to extended domains, induced by an e-beam in a few representative 2D materials, including graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, transition-metal dichalcogenides, and phosphorene. We show that atomic as well as line defects and even novel nanostructures can be created and manipulated in 2D materials by an e-beam in a controllable manner. Phase transitions can also be induced. The e-beam in a (scanning) transmission electron microscope not only resolves the intrinsic atomic structure of materials with defects, but also provides new opportunities to modify the structure with subnanometer precision.},

abstract = {Using selected-area low-energy electron diffraction analysis, we showed strict orientational alignment of monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) crystallites with Cu(100) surface lattices of Cu foil substrates during atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition. In sharp contrast, the graphene-Cu(100) system is well-known to assume a wide range of rotations despite graphene's crystallographic similarity to h-BN. Our density functional theory calculations uncovered the origin of this surprising difference: The crystallite orientation is determined during nucleation by interactions between the cluster's edges and the substrate. Unlike the weaker B- and N-Cu interactions, strong C-Cu interactions rearrange surface Cu atoms, resulting in the aligned geometry not being a distinct minimum in total energy. The discovery made in this specific case runs counter to the conventional wisdom that strong epilayer-substrate interactions enhance orientational alignment in epitaxy and sheds light on the factors that determine orientational relation in van der Waals epitaxy of 2D materials.},

However, the construction of an optimal hyperdynamics potential is a task that is far from trivial. Here, we propose a generally applicable implementation of the hyperdynamics algorithm, borrowing two concepts from metadynamics. First, the use of a collective variable (CV) to represent the accelerated dynamics gives the method a very large flexibility and simplicity. Second, a metadynamics procedure can be used to construct a suitable history-dependent bias potential on-the-fly, effectively turning the algorithm into a self-learning accelerated molecular dynamics method. This collective variable-driven hyperdynamics (CVHD) method has a modular design: both the local system properties on which the bias is based, as well as the characteristics of the biasing method itself, can be chosen to match the needs of the considered system. As a result, system-specific details are abstracted from the biasing algorithm itself, making it extremely versatile and transparent. The method is tested on three model systems: diffusion on the Cu(001) surface and nickel-catalyzed methane decomposition, as examples of ?reactive? processes with a bond-length-based CV, and the folding of a long polymer-like chain, using a set of dihedral angles as a CV. Boost factors up to 109, corresponding to a time scale of seconds, could be obtained while still accurately reproducing correct dynamics.},

abstract = {MoS2 is a promising and low-cost material for electrochemical hydrogen production due to its high activity and stability during the reaction. However, the efficiency of hydrogen production is limited by the amount of active sites, for example, edges, in MoS2. Here, we demonstrate that oxygen plasma exposure and hydrogen treatment on pristine monolayer MoS2 could introduce more active sites via the formation of defects within the monolayer, leading to a high density of exposed edges and a significant improvement of the hydrogen evolution activity. These as-fabricated defects are characterized at the scale from macroscopic continuum to discrete atoms. Our work represents a facile method to increase the hydrogen production in electrochemical reaction of MoS2 via defect engineering, and helps to understand the catalytic properties of MoS2.},

Rev. B: Condens. Matter Mater. Phys., 2013, 88, 035301], the stabilities and electronic properties of monolayer MoS2 with one or two staggered sulfur line vacancy defects (SV or DV), along the armchair or zigzag direction (AC-SV, AC-DV or ZZ-SV, ZZ-DV), have been investigated systematically by first-principles calculations. It is found that: (1) The ZZ-types (ZZ-SV and ZZ-DV) are more stable at different line vacancy densities than the AC-types (AC-SV and AC-DV), which is in good agreement with previous experimental findings. (2) More interestingly, it is predicted from our numerical calculations that, in the same ZZ-types, the ZZ-DV is more stable than the ZZ-SV, indicating that two separate ZZ-SV line vacancy defects tend to move closely to each other for coalescing into a ZZ-DV, which is in contrast to the AC-type with AC-SV being a little more stable than the AC-DV. (3) The monolayer MoS2 with the AC-SV or AC-DV are both semiconductors with a direct or an indirect band gap, respectively, both of which are significantly smaller than that of the perfect monolayer. (4) Furthermore, the out-of-plane distortion induced by strain release in the monolayer MoS2 with ZZ-SV or ZZ-DV is more severe than that with the AC-type, which can further considerably decrease the system's gap value or even make the gap nearly closed. Our calculation results will be helpful in future nanoelectronics and nanoelectromechanics based on MoS2 materials.},

abstract = {The interlayer interaction of vertically stacked heterojunctions is very sensitive to the interlayer spacing, which will affect the coupling between the monolayers and allow band structure modulation. Here, with the aid of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, an interesting phenomenon is found that MoS2-WS2, MoS2-WSe2, and WS2-WSe2 heterostructures turn into direct-gap semiconductors from indirect-gap semiconductors with increasing the interlayer space. Moreover, the electronic structure changing process with interlayer spacing of MoS2-WS2, MoS2-WSe2, and WS2-WSe2 is different from each other. With the help of variable-temperature spectral experiment, different electronic transition properties of MoS2-WS2, MoS2-WSe2, and WS2-WSe2 have been demonstrated. The transition transformation from indirect to direct can be only observed in the MoS2-WS2 heterostructure, as the valence band maximum (VBM) at the $\Gamma$ point in the MoS2-WSe2 and WS2-WSe2 heterostructure is less sensitive to the interlayer spacing than those from the MoS2-WS2 heterostructure. The present work highlights the significance of the temperature tuning in interlayer coupling and advance the research of MoS2-WS2, MoS2-WSe2, and WS2-WSe2 based device applications.},

abstract = {In the last decades, the blossoming of experimental breakthroughs in the domain of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) has triggered a variety of theoretical developments. Those have to deal with completely different situations, from atomically resolved phonon mapping to electron circular dichroism passing by surface plasmon mapping. All of them rely on very different physical approximations and have not yet been reconciled, despite early attempts to do so. As an effort in that direction, we report on the development of a scalar relativistic quantum electrodynamic (QED) approach of the inelastic scattering of fast electrons. This theory can be adapted to describe all modern EELS experiments, and under the relevant approximations, can be reduced to any of the last EELS theories. In that aim, we present in this paper the state of the art and the basics of scalar relativistic QED relevant to the electron inelastic scattering. We then give a clear relation between the two once antagonist descriptions of the EELS, the retarded green Dyadic, usually applied to describe photonic excitations and the quasi-static mixed dynamic form factor (MDFF), more adapted to describe core electronic excitations of material. We then use this theory to establish two important EELS-related equations. The first one relates the spatially resolved EELS to the imaginary part of the photon propagator and the incoming and outgoing electron beam wavefunction, synthesizing the most common theories developed for analyzing spatially resolved EELS experiments. The second one shows that the evolution of the electron beam density matrix is proportional to the mutual coherence tensor, proving that quite universally, the electromagnetic correlations in the target are imprinted in the coherence properties of the probing electron beam.},

Acoustic technologies frequently develop in tandem with optics, using shared concepts such as waveguiding and metamedia. It is thus noteworthy that an entirely novel class of electromagnetic waves, known as “topological edge states,” has recently been demonstrated. These are inspired by the electronic edge states occurring in topological insulators, and possess a striking and technologically promising property: the ability to travel in a single direction along a surface without backscattering, regardless of the existence of defects or disorder. Here, we develop an analogous theory of topological fluid acoustics, and propose a scheme for realizing topological edge states in an acoustic structure containing circulating fluids. The phenomenon of disorder-free one-way sound propagation, which does not occur in ordinary acoustic devices, may have novel applications for acoustic isolators, modulators, and transducers.},

The electronic and magnetic properties of this monolayer changed due to the presence of the TM ion dopants. The calculated substitutional energies indicate that it is energetically favourable to introduce TM ions into the MoS2 lattice under the S-rich condition compared to the Mo-rich condition. The calculated binding energies also show that TM ions exhibit a dispersive distribution rather than the suggested multi-site configurations considered in the MoS2 lattice. This is because most of the considered dopant multi-site configurations of a particular dopant ion are not energetically favourable compared to the single site configuration. Generally, there is a reduction in the electronic band gap of doped MoS2 compounds as well extra absorption peaks in the absorption spectra. The calculated redox potentials of H2O splitting show that Cr doped MoS2 monolayer can be potential photo-reductants. This theoretical investigation provides further insight into the application of MoS2 as ultra-thin spintronic material in the case of V, Fe and Mn doped monolayers.},

abstract = {The exact density functional for the ground-state energy is strictly self-interaction-free (i.e., orbitals demonstrably do not self-interact), but many approximations to it, including the local-spin-density (LSD) approximation for exchange and correlation, are not. We present two related methods for the self-interaction correction (SIC) of any density functional for the energy; correction of the self-consistent one-electron potenial follows naturally from the variational principle. Both methods are sanctioned by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. Although the first method introduces an orbital-dependent single-particle potential, the second involves a local potential as in the Kohn-Sham scheme. We apply the first method to LSD and show that it properly conserves the number content of the exchange-correlation hole, while substantially improving the description of its shape. We apply this method to a number of physical problems, where the uncorrected LSD approach produces systematic errors. We find systematic improvements, qualitative as well as quantitative, from this simple correction. Benefits of SIC in atomic calculations include (i) improved values for the total energy and for the separate exchange and correlation pieces of it, (ii) accurate binding energies of negative ions, which are wrongly unstable in LSD, (iii) more accurate electron densities, (iv) orbital eigenvalues that closely approximate physical removal energies, including relaxation, and (v) correct longrange behavior of the potential and density. It appears that SIC can also remedy the LSD underestimate of the band gaps in insulators (as shown by numerical calculations for the rare-gas solids and CuCl), and the LSD overestimate of the cohesive energies of transition metals. The LSD spin splitting in atomic Ni and s-d interconfigurational energies of transition elements are almost unchanged by SIC. We also discuss the admissibility of fractional occupation numbers, and present a parametrization of the electron-gas correlation energy at any density, based on the recent results of Ceperley and Alder. {\textcopyright} 1981 The American Physical Society.},

We calculate the formation energies of neutral and charged defects, determine the charge transition levels, and from these self-consistently assess the concentration of defects at thermal equilibrium as well as the resulting positions of the Fermi level. The chemical potential values corresponding to different growth conditions are carefully accounted for, and for all values of chemical potentials relevant to the growth of MoS2, the S vacancies are found to be the most abundant defects. However, they are acceptors and cannot be the cause of the often observed n-type doping. At the same time, Re impurities, which are often present in natural MoS2 samples, naturally provide good n-type doping behavior.

Exciton dynamics for the monolayer and few-layer structures were found to be remarkably different from those of thick crystals when probed at energies near that of the lowest energy direct exciton (A exciton). The intraband relaxation rate was enhanced by more than 40 fold in the monolayer in comparison to that observed in the thick crystals, which we attributed to defect assisted scattering. Faster electron-hole recombination was found in monolayer and few-layer structures due to quantum confinement effects that lead to an indirect-direct band gap crossover. Nonradiative rather than radiative relaxation pathways dominate the dynamics in the monolayer and few-layer MoS2. Fast trapping of excitons by surface trap states was observed in monolayer and few-layer structures, pointing to the importance of controlling surface properties in atomically thin crystals such as MoS2 along with controlling their dimensions. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that nanometer-scale TiN coatings deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD){,} and to a lesser extent by magnetron sputtering{,} will significantly improve the electrochemical cycling performance of silicon nanowire lithium-ion battery (LIB) anodes. A 5 nm thick ALD coating resulted in optimum cycling capacity retention (55% vs. 30% for the bare nanowire baseline{,} after 100 cycles) and coulombic efficiency (98% vs. 95%{,} at 50 cycles){,} also more than doubling the high rate capacity retention (e.g. 740 mA h g−1vs. 330 mA h g−1{,} at 5 C). We employed a variety of advanced analytical techniques such as electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS){,} focused ion beam analysis (FIB) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to elucidate the origin of these effects. The conformal 5 nm TiN remains sufficiently intact to limit the growth of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI){,} which in turn both improves the overall coulombic efficiency and reduces the life-ending delamination of the nanowire assemblies from the underlying current collector. Our findings should provide a broadly applicable coating design methodology that will improve the performance of any nanostructured LIB anodes where SEI growth is detrimental.},

abstract = {The dissociation of water on 2D monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) edges was studied with density functional theory. The catalytically active sites for H2O, H, and OH adsorption on MoS2 edges with 0% (Mo-edge), 50% (S50-edge), and 100% (S100-edge) sulfur coverage were determined, and the Mo-edge was found to be the most favorable for adsorption of all species. The water dissociation reaction was then simulated on all edges using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) technique. The reaction was found to be endothermic on the S100-edge and exothermic for the S50- and Mo-edges, with the Mo-edge having the lowest activation energy barrier. Water dissociation was then explored on the Mo-edge using metadynamics biased ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) methods to explore the reaction mechanism at finite temperature. These simulations revealed that water dissociation can proceed by two mechanisms: the first by splitting into adsorbed OH and H species produced a particularly small activation free energy barrier of 0.06 eV (5.89 kJ/mol), and the second by formation of desorbed H2 and adsorbed O atom had a higher activation barrier of 0.36 eV (34.74 kJ/mol) which was nevertheless relatively small. These activation barrier results, along with reaction rate calculations, suggest that water dissociation will occur spontaneously at room temperature on the Mo-edge.},

In particular, a preferential nucleation site and direction-dependent pinning of domain walls is observed due to slow kinetics of metastable switching in the sample without a bottom electrode.

abstract = {In the present work we calculate the phonon-limited mobility in intrinsic n-type single-layer MoS2 as a function of carrier density and temperature for T > 100 K. Using a first-principles approach for the calculation of the electron-phonon interaction, the deformation potentials and Fr\"ohlich interaction in the isolated MoS2 layer are determined. We find that the calculated room-temperature mobility of $\sim$410 cm^2 V^-1 s^-1 is dominated by optical phonon scattering via deformation potential couplings and the Fr\"ohlich interaction with the deformation potentials to the intravalley homopolar and intervalley longitudinal optical phonons given by 4.1 x 10^8 eV/cm and 2.6 x 10^8 eV/cm, respectively. The mobility is weakly dependent on the carrier density and follows a \mu $\sim$ T^-1 temperature dependence with \gamma = 1.69 at room temperature. It is shown that a quenching of the characteristic homopolar mode which is likely to occur in top-gated samples, boosts the mobility with 70 cm^2 V^-1 s^-1 and can be observed as a decrease in the exponent to \gamma = 1.52. Our findings indicate that the intrinsic phonon-limited mobility is approached in samples where a high-kappa dielectric that effectively screens charge impurities is used as gate oxide.},

abstract = {Atomically thin tungsten disulfide (WS2), a structural analogue to MoS2, has attracted great interest due to its indirect-to-direct band-gap tunability, giant spin splitting, and valley-related physics. However, the batch production of layered WS2 is underdeveloped (as compared with that of MoS2) for exploring these fundamental issues and developing its applications. Here, using a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition method, we demonstrate that high-crystalline mono- and few-layer WS2 flakes and even complete layers can be synthesized on sapphire with the domain size exceeding 50 × 50 $\mu$m2. Intriguingly, we show that, with adding minor H2 carrier gas, the shape of monolayer WS2 flakes can be tailored from jagged to straight edge triangles and still single crystalline. Meanwhile, some intersecting triangle shape flakes are concomitantly evolved from more than one nucleus to show a polycrystalline nature. It is interesting to see that, only through a mild sample oxidation process, the grain boundaries are easily recognizable by scanning electron microscopy due to its altered contrasts. Hereby, controlling the initial nucleation state is crucial for synthesizing large-scale single-crystalline flakes. We believe that this work would benefit the controlled growth of high-quality transition metal dichalcogenide, as well as in their future applications in nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, and solar energy conversions.},

The stability, electronic structure, and electron transport properties of metallic monoatomic wires anchored on the MoS 2 monolayer are investigated within the density functional theory. The anchoring of the atomic wires on the semiconducting monolayer significantly modifies its electronic properties; the metallic characteristics of the assembled monolayers appear in the density of states and band structure of the system. We find that Cu, Ag and Au wires induce the so-called n-type doping effect, whereas Pt wires induce a p-type doping effect in the monolayer. The distinctly different behavior of Pt–MoS 2 compared to the rest of the metallic wires is reflected in the calculated current–voltage characteristics of the assembled monolayers with a highly asymmetric behavior of the out-of-the-plane tunneling current with respect to the polarity of the external bias. The results of the present study are likely to extend the functionality of the MoS 2 monolayer as a candidate material for the novel applications in the areas of catalysis and optoelectronic devices.},

abstract = {We study the atomic scale microstructure of nonstoichiometric two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide MoSe2-x by employing aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. We show that a Se-deficit in single layers of MoSe2 grown by molecular beam epitaxy gives rise to a dense network of mirror-twin-boundaries (MTBs) decorating the 2D-grains. With the use of density functional theory calculations, we further demonstrate that MTBs are thermodynamically stable structures in Se-deficient sheets. These line defects host spatially localized states with energies close to the valence band minimum, thus giving rise to enhanced conductance along straight MTBs. However, electronic transport calculations show that the transmission of hole charge carriers across MTBs is strongly suppressed due to band bending effects. We further observe formation of MTBs during in situ removal of Se atoms by the electron beam of the microscope, thus confirming that MTBs appear due to Se-deficit, and not coalescence of individual grains during growth. At a very high local Se-deficit, the 2D sheet becomes unstable and transforms to a nanowire. Our results on Se-deficient MoSe2 suggest routes toward engineering the properties of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides by deviations from the stoichiometric composition.},

We discuss general strategies for synthesizing catalysts with improved activity, namely, increasing the number of electrically accessible active sites or increasing the turnover frequency of each site. Then we consider a number of state-of-the-art molybdenum sulfide catalysts, including crystalline MoS2, amorphous MoSx, and molecular cluster materials, to highlight these strategies in practice. Comparing these catalysts reveals that most of the molybdenum sulfide catalysts have similar active site turnover frequencies, so the total electrode activity is primarily determined by the number of accessible active sites per geometric electrode area. Emerging strategies to overcome current catalyst limitations and potential applications for molybdenum sulfide catalysts including photoelectrochemical water splitting devices and electrolyzers are also considered},

abstract = {The hybrid halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 exhibits a complex structural behaviour, with successive transitions between orthorhombic, tetragonal and cubic polymorphs at ca. 165 K and 327 K. Herein we report first-principles lattice dynamics (phonon spectrum) for each phase of CH3NH3PbI3. The equilibrium structures compare well to solutions of temperature-dependent powder neutron diffraction. By following the normal modes we calculate infrared and Raman intensities of the vibrations, and compare them to the measurement of a single crystal where the Raman laser is controlled to avoid degradation of the sample. Despite a clear separation in energy between low frequency modes associated with the inorganic PbI3 network and high-frequency modes of the organic CH3NH3+ cation, significant coupling between them is found, which emphasises the interplay between molecular orientation and the corner-sharing octahedral networks in the structural transformations. Soft modes are found at the boundary of the Brillouin zone of the cubic phase, consistent with displacive instabilities and anharmonicity involving tilting of the PbI6 octahedra around room temperature.},

abstract = {Control of carrier type and carrier density provides a way to tune the physical properties of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors. Modulation doping of heterostructures can effectively inject carriers into or extract carriers from the 2D semiconductors, and eliminate the adverse effect from the ionized dopants. Here we first investigate the layer-dependent negative trion PL of 2D MoS2, and further construct heterostructures with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and transition metal oxides (TMOs). By choosing the oxide with different charge neutrality levels (CNLs), we demonstrate effective electron injection into MoS2 by TiO2 doping, and electron extraction from MoS2 by MoO3 doping. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra and electrical characterization show that thicker MoS2 flakes are more easily n-doped by TiO2, while thinner MoS2 flakes are more easily p-doped by MoO3. Our experimental results are in good agreement with theoretical calculations. The modulation doping with TMO is compatible with conventional Si processing and highly air-stable. This method can also be extended for the controllable doping of other 2D materials.},

We here experimentally and theoretically investigate triangular vacancies in (unconventional) Bernal-stacked AB-h-BN formed using a high-energy electron beam. Due to the geometric configuration of AB-h-BN, triangular pores in different layers are aligned, and their sizes are controlled by the duration of the electron irradiation. Interlayer covalent bonding at the vacancy edge is not favored, as opposed to what occurs in the more common AA′-stacked BN. A variety of monolayer, concentric, and bilayer pores in the bilayer AB-h-BN are observed in high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and characterized using ab initio simulations. Bilayer pores in AB-h-BN are commonly formed and grow without breaking the bilayer character. Nanopores in AB-h-BN exhibit a wide range of electronic properties, ranging from half-metallic to non-magnetic and magnetic semiconductors. Therefore, because of the controllability of the pore size, the electronic structure is also highly controllable in these systems and can potentially be tuned for particular applications.},

We begin this review by discussing underpinnings of the topological band theory, which basically involves a layer of analysis and interpretation for assessing topological properties of band structures beyond the standard band theory construct. Methods for evaluating topological invariants are delineated, including crystals without inversion symmetry and interacting systems. The extent to which theoretically predicted properties and protections of topological states have been verified experimentally is discussed, including work on topological crystalline insulators, disorder/interaction driven topological insulators (TIs), topological superconductors, Weyl semimetal phases, and topological phase transitions. Successful strategies for new materials discovery process are outlined. A comprehensive survey of currently predicted 2D and 3D topological materials is provided. This includes binary, ternary and quaternary compounds, transition metal and f-electron materials, Weyl and 3D Dirac semimetals, complex oxides, organometallics, skutterudites and antiperovskites. Also included is the emerging area of 2D atomically thin films beyond graphene of various elements and their alloys, functional thin films, multilayer systems, and ultra-thin films of 3D TIs, all of which hold exciting promise of wide-ranging applications.

It is shown that the G0W0 approximation always yields too small band gaps. To improve agreement with experiment, the eigenvalues in the Green's function G (GW0) and in the Green's function and the dielectric matrix (GW) are updated until self-consistency is reached. The first approximation leads to excellent agreement with experiment, whereas an update of the eigenvalues in G and W gives too large band gaps for virtually all materials. From a pragmatic point of view, the GW0 approximation thus seems to be an accurate and still reasonably fast method for predicting quasiparticle energies in simple sp-bonded systems. We furthermore observe that the band gaps in materials with shallow d states (GaAs, GaN, and ZnO) are systematically underestimated. We propose that an inaccurate description of the static dielectric properties of these materials is responsible for the underestimation of the band gaps in GW0, which is itself a result of the incomplete cancellation of the Hartree self-energy within the d shell by local or gradient corrected density functionals.},

abstract = {Methanation and reverse water-gas shift reaction are two important reactions that could happen simultaneously during the process of CO2 reduction. Exploiting new catalysts with high selectivity towards one single process is highly desirable. It has been shown that isolated-Rh/TiO2 can selectively generate CO rather than CH4. A molecular level understanding would provide more insight into catalyst design for CO2 reduction. In the present contribution, the density functional theory method was employed to study the CO2 reduction reaction by H2 based on a Rh1/TiO2 (101) model. The co-adsorbed CO2 and H2 on the Rh atom can react with each other to form CO. The inhibition of further H2 adsorption on the CO pre-adsorbed Rh atom stops the following sequential hydrogenation of CO. This can explain the experimentally observed high selectivity of Rh1/TiO2 to CO. Different co-adsorption properties can be understood by the frontier orbital charge density symmetry matching principle. The same method has been extended to other metal systems (Ru, Pd and Pt) to identify candidate catalysts with high selectivity for CO2 reduction. Similar adsorption properties of isolated Pd with Rh may induce high selectivity towards CO. These results are expected to provide a prediction to find new selective catalysts for CO2 reduction.},

abstract = {A key quantity for molecule-metal interfaces is the energy level alignment of molecular electronic states with the metallic Fermi level. We develop and apply an efficient theoretical method, based on density functional theory (DFT) that can yield quantitatively accurate energy level alignment information for physisorbed metal?molecule interfaces. The method builds on the ?DFT+$\Sigma$? approach, grounded in many-body perturbation theory, which introduces an approximate electron self-energy that corrects the level alignment obtained from conventional DFT for missing exchange and correlation effects associated with the gas-phase molecule and substrate polarization. Here, we extend the DFT+$\Sigma$ approach in two important ways: first, we employ optimally tuned range-separated hybrid functionals to compute the gas-phase term, rather than rely on GW or total energy differences as in prior work; second, we use a nonclassical DFT-determined image-charge plane of the metallic surface to compute the substrate polarization term, rather than the classical DFT-derived image plane used previously. We validate this new approach by a detailed comparison with experimental and theoretical reference data for several prototypical molecule?metal interfaces, where excellent agreement with experiment is achieved: benzene on graphite (0001), and 1,4-benzenediamine, Cu-phthalocyanine, and 3,4,9,10-perylene-tetracarboxylic-dianhydride on Au(111). In particular, we show that the method correctly captures level alignment trends across chemical systems and that it retains its accuracy even for molecules for which conventional DFT suffers from severe self-interaction errors.},

abstract = {Recent studies have revealed that single-layer transition-metal oxides and dichalcogenides (MX2) might offer properties superior to those of graphene. So far, only very few MX2 compounds have been synthesized as suspended single layers, and some of them have been exfoliated as thin sheets. Using first-principles structure optimization and phonon calculations based on density functional theory, we predict that, out of 88 different combinations of MX2 compounds, several of them can be stable in free-standing, single-layer honeycomb-like structures. These materials have two-dimensional hexagonal lattices and have top-view appearances as if they consisted of either honeycombs or centered honeycombs. However, their bonding is different from that of graphene; they can be viewed as a positively charged plane of transition-metal atoms sandwiched between two planes of negatively charged oxygen or chalcogen atoms. Electron correlation in transition-metal oxides was treated by including Coulomb repulsion through LDA + U calculations. Our analysis of stability was extended to include in-plane stiffness, as well as ab initio, finite-temperature molecular dynamics calculations. Some of these single-layer structures are direct- or indirect-band-gap semiconductors, only one compound is half-metal, and the rest are either ferromagnetic or nonmagnetic metals. Because of their surface polarity, band gap, high in-plane stiffness, and suitability for functionalization by adatoms or vacancies, these single-layer structures can be utilized in a wide range of technological applications, especially as nanoscale coatings for surfaces contributing crucial functionalities. In particular, the manifold WX2 heralds exceptional properties promising future nanoscale applications.},

abstract = {A linear stability analysis is applied to the study of the compact-fractal island morphological transition during epitaxial growth. The analysis includes the diffusion mediated interaction between islands within a self-consistent mean-field theory. A scaling form is derived for the length of the island edges. Results are confirmed by comparison with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. PACS numbers: 61.43.Hv, 82.20.Mj Single atom high islands which form during the early stages (submonolayer) of epitaxial growth exhibit mor-phologies which range from ramified structures to com-pact polygonal shapes. For example, scanning tunneling microscopy images of Au on Ru(0001) grown at room temperature reveal fractal islands. Deposition of Co on the same substrate produces compact triangular islands [1]. Similarly, ramified islands are observed for Pt on Pt at low temperature, and compact islands are found for higher temperatures [2]. In this work the dependence of the island morphologies on externally controlled growth parameters is addressed. It is important to understand this dependence, since these islands form the template upon which all further growth proceeds [3]. The observation of ramified island growth has been understood [1] by comparison with the simplest "hit and stick" model of diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) [4]. In this model, a particle diffuses on the substrate to an island from far away and sticks at the first point of contact with the cluster. The fractal dimension for a DLA cluster is identical to that measured for islands of Au on Ru(0001) [1]. However, the growth of islands during epitaxy differs from DLA in two very important respects: (1) Atoms which diffuse to the island relax to a lower energy site, e.g. , by diffusion along the edge of the island (edge diffusion). As the rate of relaxation increases relative to the rate at which atoms diffuse Io the island, a morphological transition occurs from ramified island growth to compact island growth. For an isolated island this competition is well understood [5,6]. (2) The islands grow in the presence of other islands on the surface and, therefore, compete for the available diffusing monomers. The effects of this complication on the island morphology are not yet well understood. In fact, there is disagreement in recent literature [7 — 9] as to the dependence of the transition on the growth parameters. In this paper, the morphological transition is studied by considering the shape stability of a compact island. A linear stability analysis, similar to that applied to the study of the Mullins-Sekerka instability [10], is used to study the stability of a circular island with respect to infinitesimal morphological fluctuations. In contrast to a traditional stability analysis [5,11], the environment surrounding any particular island on the surface is changing with time during the growth process, due to the presence of the other islands. In this work, therefore, the stability analysis is combined with a self-consistent mean-field theory which describes accurately average properties of the entire surface [12]. Based on this novel approach and the results of kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations a new scaling law is formulated, and the disagreements in the literature reconciled. During the growth process, a competition develops between the nucleation of new islands on the substrate and the capture of monomers by already existing islands. This competition leads to a simple relation between the average distance between islands 4, the deposition flux F, and the monomer diffusion constant D, namely, where the exponent y depends on the critical nucleus size [13]. The current work focuses on irreversible growth in which a dimer is stable and g = 1/6. Similarly, it is shown here that the balance of the competing effects of ramified growth and smoothing by edge diffusion also leads to a simple scaling form. Near the transition to ramified island growth the fraction n, of deposited atoms that are at the edge of an island obeys n where I measures the rate at which atoms diffuse around the edge of the island and f is the scaling function. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations based on simple energetics provide a useful tool to investigate scaling relationships such as Eqs. (1) and (2). The current simulations are performed on a square lattice. The monomers hop on the bare substrate at a rate of hD = ve t'$\sim$', where v is the attempt frequency, P is the reciprocal temperature, and F, is the energy barrier to monomer diffusion on the substrate (note that D = ho/4). Attachment of monomers to other monomers and existing islands is assumed irreversible.},

abstract = {Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as MoS2 , MoSe2 , and WSe2 have emerged as promising two-dimensional semiconductors. Many anticipated applications of these materials require both p-type and n-type TMDs with long-term doping stability. Here, we report on the synthesis of substitutionally doped WSe2 crystals using Nb and Re as p- and n-type dopants, respectively. Hall coefficient and gate-dependent transport measurements reveal drastically different doping properties between nominally 0.5% Nb- and 0.5% Re-doped WSe2 . While 0.5% Nb-doped WSe2 ( WSe2∶ Nb ) is degenerately hole doped with a nearly temperature-independent carrier density of approximately 10^19 cm−3 , electrons in 0.5% Re-doped WSe2 ( WSe2 ∶ Re ) are largely trapped in localized states below the mobility edge and exhibit thermally activated behavior.

Furthermore, we fabricate vertical van der Waals–junction diodes consisting of multilayers of WSe2∶Nb and WSe2∶ Re.

abstract = {The evolution of real-time medical diagnostic tools such as angiography and computer tomography from radiography based on photographic plates was enabled by the development of integrated solid-state X-ray photon detectors made from conventional solid-state semiconductors. Recently, for optoelectronic devices operating in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions, solution-processed organic and inorganic semiconductors have also attracted a great deal of attention. Here, we demonstrate a possibility to use such inexpensive semiconductors for the sensitive detection of X-ray photons by direct photon-to-current conversion. In particular, methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) offers a compelling combination of fast photoresponse and a high absorption cross-section for X-rays, owing to the heavy Pb and I atoms. Solution-processed photodiodes as well as photoconductors are presented, exhibiting high values of X-ray sensitivity (up to 25 $\mu$C mGyair−1 cm−3) and responsivity (1.9 × 104 carriers/photon), which are commensurate with those obtained by the current solid-state technology.},

abstract = {On the basis of first-principles G0W0 calculations we study systematically how the electronic levels of a benzene molecule are renormalized by substrate polarization when physisorbed on different metallic and semiconducting surfaces. The polarization-induced reduction of the energy gap between occupied and unoccupied molecular levels is found to scale with the substrate density of states at the Fermi level (for metals) and substrate band gap (for semiconductors). These conclusions are further supported by GW calculations on simple lattice models. By expressing the electron self-energy in terms of the substrate's joint density of states we relate the level shift to the surface electronic structure thus providing a microscopic explanation of the trends in the G0W0 calculations. While image charge effects are not captured by semi-local and hybrid exchange-correlation functionals, we find that error cancellations lead to remarkably good agreement between the G0W0 and Kohn-Sham energies for the occupied orbitals of the adsorbed molecule.},

abstract = {We report Density Functional Theory (M06L) calculations including Poisson-Boltzmann solvation to determine the reaction pathways and barriers for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on MoS2, using both a periodic two dimensional slab and a Mo10S21 cluster model. We find that the HER mechanism involves protonation of the electron rich molybdenum hydride site (Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism), leading to a calculated free energy barrier of 17.9 kcal/mol, in good agreement with the barrier of 19.9 kcal/mol estimated from the experimental turnover frequency. Hydronium proto-nation of the hydride on the Mo site is 21.3 kcal/mol more favorable than protonation of the hydrogen on the S site be-cause the electrons localized on the Mo-H bond are readily transferred to form dihydrogen with hydronium. We predict the Volmer-Tafel mechanism in which hydrogen atoms bound to molybdenum and sulfur sites recombine to form H2 has a barrier of 22.6 kcal/mol. Starting with hydrogen atoms on adjacent sulfur atoms, the Volmer-Tafel mechanism goes in-stead through the M-H + S-H pathway. In discussions of metal chalcogenide HER catalysis, the S-H bond energy has been proposed as the critical parameter. However, we find that the sulfur-hydrogen species is not an important intermediate since the free energy of this species does not play a direct role in determining the effective activation barrier. Rather we suggest that kinetic barrier should be used as a descriptor for reactivity, rather than the equilibrium thermodynamics. This is supported by the agreement between the calculated barrier and the experimental turnover frequency. These results suggest that to design a more reactive catalyst from edge exposed MoS2, one should focus on lowering the reaction barrier between the metal hydride and a proton from the hydronium in solution.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry. Highly aligned, packed, and doped carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers with electrical conductivities approaching that of copper have recently become available. These fibers are promising for high-power electrical applications that require light-weight, high current-carrying capacity cables. However, a microscopic understanding of how doping affects the electrical conductance of such CNT fibers in a quantitative manner has been lacking. Here, we performed Raman spectroscopy measurements combined with first-principles calculations to determine the position of the average Fermi energy and to obtain the temperature of chlorosulfonic-acid-doped double-wall CNT fibers under high current. Due to the unique way in which double-wall CNT Raman spectra depend on doping, it is possible to use Raman data to determine the doping level quantitatively. The correspondence between the Fermi level shift and the carbon charge transfer is derived from a tight-binding model and validated by several calculations. For the doped fiber, we were able to associate an average Fermi energy shift of ∼-0.7 eV with a conductance increase by a factor of ∼5. Furthermore, since current induces heating, local temperature determination is possible. Through the Stokes-to-anti-Stokes intensity ratio of the G-band peaks, we estimated a temperature rise at the fiber surface of ∼135 K at a current density of 2.27 × 108 A m-2 identical to that from the G-band shift, suggesting that thermalization between CNTs is well achieved.},

The introduction of Cl-dopant in ZnO increases free electrons in the conduction band of ZnO and also leads to the rough surface of ZnO NWAs, which greatly improves the field emission properties of the Cl-ZnO NWAs/GF. The Cl-ZnO NWAs/GF demonstrates a low turn-on field ( approximately 1.6 V mum(-1)), a high field enhancement factor ( approximately 12844), and excellent field emission stability. Also, the Cl-ZnO NWAs/GF shows high photocatalytic efficiency under UV irradiation, enabling photodegradation of organic dyes such as RhB within approximately 75 min, with excellent recyclability. The excellent photocatalytic performance of the Cl-ZnO NWAs/GF originates from the highly efficient charge separation efficiency at the heterointerface of Cl-ZnO and GF, as well as improved electron transport efficiency due to the doping of Cl. These results open up new possibilities of using Cl-ZnO and graphene-based hybrid nanostructures for various functional devices.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Physical Society. We report experiments and calculations investigating the pressure and temperature dependences of the optical phonons in BaZrS3, and the pressure dependence of its absorption edge. BaZrS3 is a chalcogenide perovskite in a novel class of materials being considered for photovoltaics. It is studied by Raman spectroscopy as functions of temperature (at 1 atm) and pressure (at 120 and 295 K), and by pressure-transmission spectroscopy at 295 K. Density-functional-theory calculations predict the allowed Raman lines, their intensities, their pressure shifts, and the band-gap pressure shift. Cooling shifts all but one of the phonon peaks to higher frequencies; the temperature coefficients are typical of semiconductors. A strong low-temperature peak at 392.3 cm-1 is attributed to resonant forbidden LO scattering; its shift with temperature has the opposite sign. The pressure coefficients of the phonon frequencies for all observed Raman peaks are positive, indicating no mode softening. The rates of pressure shift also are typical, and show the customary scaling with phonon frequency. Experiment and theory show good agreement on the pressure-induced frequency shifts. The BaZrS3 absorption edge moves to lower energy with pressure, reflecting a reduction of the band gap. The measured shift is ∼-0.015 eV/GPa, slightly less than the density-functional-theory result of -0.025 eV/GPa. We find no evidence that the perovskite structure of BaZ rS3 undergoes any phase changes under hydrostatic pressure to at least 8.9 GPa. Our results indicate the robust structural stability of BaZrS3, and suggest cation alloying as a viable approach for band-gap engineering for photovoltaic and other applications.},

Two alternative state and parameter estimation strategies, extended Kalman filtering and NLP optimization, are also considered. When no a priori known model of the unobserved process parameters is available, the hybrid network model gives better estimates of the parameters, when compared to these methods. By providing a model of these un-measured parameters, the hybrid network can also make predictions and hence can be used for process optimization. These results apply both when full and partial state measurements are available, but in the latter case a state reconstruction method must be used for the first principles component of the hybrid model.},

Based on the separations between the energy peak positions of the FX emission lines, the identical PL decay kinetics among different FX emission lines, and the known phonon modes in h-BN, we suggest that there is only one principal emission line corresponding to the direct intrinsic FX transition in h-BN, whereas all other fine features are a result of phonon-assisted transitions.

abstract = {An improved way of estimating the local tangent in the nudged elastic band method for finding minimum energy paths is presented. In systems where the force along the minimum energy path is large compared to the restoring force perpendicular to the path and when many images of the system are included in the elastic band, kinks can develop and prevent the band from converging to the minimum energy path. We show how the kinks arise and present an improved way of estimating the local tangent which solves the problem. The task of finding an accurate energy and configuration for the saddle point is also discussed and examples given where a complementary method, the dimer method, is used to efficiently converge to the saddle point. Both methods only require the first derivative of the energy and can, therefore, easily be applied in plane wave based density-functional theory calculations. Examples are given from studies of the exchange diffusion mechanism in a Si crystal, Al addimer formation on the Al(100) surface, and dissociative adsorption of CH 4 on an Ir(111) surface.},

abstract = {The \{{\textbackslash}AA}ngstr{\textbackslash}"om-sized probe of the scanning transmission electron microscope can visualize and collect spectra from single atoms. This can unambiguously resolve the chemical structure of materials, but not their isotopic composition. Here we differentiate between two isotopes of the same element by quantifying how likely the energetic imaging electrons are to eject atoms. First, we measure the displacement probability in graphene grown from either \${\textasciicircum}{12}$C or \${\textasciicircum}{13}$C and describe the process using a quantum mechanical model of lattice vibrations coupled with density functional theory simulations. We then test our spatial resolution in a mixed sample by ejecting individual atoms from nanoscale areas spanning an interface region that is far from atomically sharp, mapping the isotope concentration with a precision better than 20%. Although we use a scanning instrument, our method should be applicable to any atomic resolution transmission electron microscope and to other low-dimensional materials.},

It is proved that there exists a universal functional of the density, F[n(r)], independent of v(r), such that the expression E≡∫v(r)n(r)dr+F[n(r)] has as its minimum value the correct ground-state energy associated with v(r). The functional F[n(r)] is then discussed for two situations: (1) n(r)=n0+ñ(r), ñ/n0≪1, and (2) n(r)=ϕ(r/r0) with ϕ arbitrary and r0→∞. In both cases F can be expressed entirely in terms of the correlation energy and linear and higher order electronic polarizabilities of a uniform electron gas. This approach also sheds some light on generalized Thomas-Fermi methods and their limitations. Some new extensions of these methods are presented.},

abstract = {van der Waals epitaxial growth of graphene on c-plane (0001) sapphire by CVD without a metal catalyst is presented. The effects of CH(4) partial pressure, growth temperature, and H(2)/CH(4) ratio were investigated and growth conditions optimized. The formation of monolayer graphene was shown by Raman spectroscopy, optical transmission, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), and low voltage transmission electron microscopy (LVTEM). Electrical analysis revealed that a room temperature Hall mobility above 2000 cm(2)/V{\textperiodcentered}s was achieved, and the mobility and carrier type were correlated to growth conditions. Both GIXRD and LVTEM studies confirm a dominant crystal orientation (principally graphene [10-10] || sapphire [11-20]) for about 80-90% of the material concomitant with epitaxial growth. The initial phase of the nucleation and the lateral growth from the nucleation seeds were observed using atomic force microscopy. The initial nuclei density was $\sim$24 $\mu$m(-2), and a lateral growth rate of $\sim$82 nm/min was determined. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the binding between graphene and sapphire is dominated by weak dispersion interactions and indicate that the epitaxial relation as observed by GIXRD is due to preferential binding of small molecules on sapphire during early stages of graphene formation.},

However, there has been very little study of the issue of stability, which restricts the outdoor application of PSCs. The issues of the degradation of perovskite and the stability of PSC devices should be urgently addressed to achieve good reproducibility and long lifetimes for PSCs with high conversion efficiency. Without studies on stability, exciting achievements cannot be transferred from the laboratory to industry and outdoor applications. In order to improve their stability, a basic understanding of the degradation process of PSCs in different conditions should be acquired via thorough study. This review summarizes recent studies of the relationship of the chemical stability of PSCs with their environment (oxygen and moisture, UV light, solution process, temperature) and corresponding possible solutions.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional materials are attractive for use in next-generation nanoelectronic devices because, compared to one-dimensional materials, it is relatively easy to fabricate complex structures from them. The most widely studied two-dimensional material is graphene, both because of its rich physics and its high mobility. However, pristine graphene does not have a bandgap, a property that is essential for many applications, including transistors. Engineering a graphene bandgap increases fabrication complexity and either reduces mobilities to the level of strained silicon films or requires high voltages. Although single layers of MoS(2) have a large intrinsic bandgap of 1.8 eV (ref. 16), previously reported mobilities in the 0.5-3 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) range are too low for practical devices. Here, we use a halfnium oxide gate dielectric to demonstrate a room-temperature single-layer MoS(2) mobility of at least 200 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1), similar to that of graphene nanoribbons, and demonstrate transistors with room-temperature current on/off ratios of 1 × 10(8) and ultralow standby power dissipation. Because monolayer MoS(2) has a direct bandgap, it can be used to construct interband tunnel FETs, which offer lower power consumption than classical transistors. Monolayer MoS(2) could also complement graphene in applications that require thin transparent semiconductors, such as optoelectronics and energy harvesting.},

The S vacancy introduces defect levels 0/-1 at 1.23 eV and -1/-2 at 1.28 eV in the upper gap. Its formation energy becomes small or negative for EF near the conduction band edge, leading to EF pinning near the conduction band for reactive metal contacts and lower contact resistances.

With the goal of discovering novel two-dimensional (2D) materials with unusual compositions and structures, we have developed a grand-canonical evolutionary algorithm that searches the structure and composition space while constraining the thickness of the structures. Coupling the algorithm to first-principles total-energy methods, we show that this approach can successfully identify known 2D materials and find low-energy ones. We present the details of the algorithm, including suitable objective functions, and illustrate its potential with a study of the Sn-S and C-Si binary materials systems. The algorithm identifies several 2D structures of InP, recovers known 2D structures in the binary Sn-S and C-Si systems, and finds two 1D Si defects in graphene with formation energies below that of isolated substitutional Si atoms.},

The transistor based on few layer ReS2 shows an n-type behavior with the mobility of about 40 cm2 V−1 s−1 and on/off ratio of 105. The polarization dependence of photoresponse is ascribed to the unique anisotropic in-plane crystal structure, consistent with the optical absorption anisotropy.

Previous efforts to form two-dimensional dilute magnetic semiconductors utilized extrinsic doping techniques or bulk crystal growth, detrimentally affecting uniformity, scalability, or Curie temperature. Here, we demonstrate an in situ substitutional doping of Fe atoms into MoS2 monolayers in the chemical vapor deposition growth. The iron atoms substitute molybdenum sites in MoS2 crystals, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and Raman signatures. We uncover an Fe-related spectral transition of Fe:MoS2 monolayers that appears at 2.28 eV above the pristine bandgap and displays pronounced ferromagnetic hysteresis. The microscopic origin is further corroborated by density functional theory calculations of dipole-allowed transitions in Fe:MoS2. Using spatially integrating magnetization measurements and spatially resolving nitrogen-vacancy center magnetometry, we show that Fe:MoS2 monolayers remain magnetized even at ambient conditions, manifesting ferromagnetism at room temperature.},

Specimens were doped with H by heating in H-2 gas at 1300 degreesC followed by quenching. They were then irradiated with 6-MeV electrons at 270, 200, 130, and 77 K. We measured their optical-absorption spectra at 7 K with an Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. We observed many optical absorption peaks which are due to localized vibrational modes of H bound to various point defects. The irradiation temperature dependence of concentrations of some H-point defect complexes was not monotonic contrary to the prediction of metastable Frenkel pair models. Relative intensities of those peaks depended on the irradiation temperature and were interpreted to be due to the relative mobilities of various point defects. The migration energies of a self-interstitial and a Frenkel pair relative to that of a vacancy were determined.},

In conventional p-n junctions, the adjacent p- and n-type regions of a semiconductor are formed by chemical doping. Ambipolar semiconductors, such as carbon nanotubes, nanowires and organic molecules, allow for p-n junctions to be configured and modified by electrostatic gating. This electrical control enables a single device to have multiple functionalities. Here, we report ambipolar monolayer WSe2 devices in which two local gates are used to define a p-n junction within the WSe2 sheet. With these electrically tunable p-n junctions, we demonstrate both p-n and n-p diodes with ideality factors better than 2. Under optical excitation, the diodes demonstrate a photodetection responsivity of 210 mA W(-1) and photovoltaic power generation with a peak external quantum efficiency of 0.2%, promising values for a nearly transparent monolayer material in a lateral device geometry. Finally, we demonstrate a light-emitting diode based on monolayer WSe2.

abstract = {Creating materials with ultimate control over their physical properties is vital for a wide range of applications. From a traditional materials design perspective, this task often requires precise control over the atomic composition and structure. However, owing to their mechanical properties, low-dimensional layered materials can actually withstand a significant amount of strain and thus sustain elastic deformations before fracture. This, in return, presents a unique technique for tuning their physical properties by ?strain engineering?. Here, we find that local strain induced on ReSe2, a new member of the transition metal dichalcogenides family, greatly changes its magnetic, optical, and electrical properties. Local strain induced by generation of wrinkle (1) modulates the optical gap as evidenced by red-shifted photoluminescence peak, (2) enhances light emission, (3) induces magnetism, and (4) modulates the electrical properties. The results not only allow us to create materials with vastly different properties at the nanoscale, but also enable a wide range of applications based on 2D materials, including strain sensors, stretchable electrodes, flexible field-effect transistors, artificial-muscle actuators, solar cells, and other spintronic, electromechanical, piezoelectric, photonic devices.},

We have employed a combination of GW (G = Green's function; W = screened Coulomb interaction) calculations of the SAM quasi-particle energies and a semiclassical image potential model to account for surface polarization effects. We find that it is essential to include both quasi-particle corrections and surface screening in order to provide a reasonable estimate of the energy level alignment at a SAM−metal interface.

abstract = {Weyl and Dirac semimetals are three dimensional phases of matter with gapless electronic excitations that are protected by topology and symmetry. As three dimensional analogs of graphene, they have generated much recent interest. Deep connections exist with particle physics models of relativistic chiral fermions, and -- despite their gaplessness -- to solid-state topological and Chern insulators. Their characteristic electronic properties lead to protected surface states and novel responses to applied electric and magnetic fields. Here we review the theoretical foundations of these phases, their proposed realizations in solid state systems, recent experiments on candidate materials, as well as their relation to other states of matter.},

This can unambiguously resolve the chemical structure of materials, but not their isotopic composition. Here we differentiate between two isotopes of the same element by quantifying how likely the energetic imaging electrons are to eject atoms. First, we measure the displacement probability in graphene grown from either 12C or 13C and describe the process using a quantum mechanical model of lattice vibrations coupled with density functional theory simulations. We then test our spatial resolution in a mixed sample by ejecting individual atoms from nanoscale areas spanning an interface region that is far from atomically sharp, mapping the isotope concentration with a precision better than 20%. Although we use a scanning instrument, our method may be applicable to any atomic resolution transmission electron microscope and to other low-dimensional materials.},

abstract = {Accurate prediction of band gap for new emerging materials is highly desirable for the exploration of potential applications. The band gaps of bulk and monolayer TMDs (MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2) are calculated with the recently proposed by us GVJ-2e method, which is implemented within DFT framework without adjustable parameters and is based on the total energies only. The calculated band gaps are in very good agreement with experimental ones for both bulk and monolayer TMDs. For monolayer MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2, direct band gaps are predicted to be 1.88 eV, 1.57 eV, 2.03 eV, 1.67 eV correspondingly, and for bulk TMDs, indirect band gaps of 1.23 eV (MoS2), 1.09 eV (MoSe2), 1.32 eV (WS2), 1.21 eV (WSe2) are predicted. The GVJ-2e method demonstrates good accuracy with mean absolute error (MAE) of about 0.03 eV for TMDs PL gaps (and 0.06 eV for QP gaps). GVJ-2e method allows to equally accurately obtain band gaps for 3D and 2D materials. The errors of GVJ-2e method are significantly smaller than errors of other widely used methods such as GW (MAE 0.23 eV), hybrid functional HSE (MAE 0.17 eV), TB-mBJ functional (MAE 0.14 eV).},

abstract = {The local spin-density (LSD) functional and Perdew–Wang 91 (PW91) generalized gradient approximations to atomization energies of molecules are investigated. We discuss the coupling-constant dependence of the atomization energy and why exchange errors of the functionals are greater than exchange–correlation errors. This fact helps to justify hybrid schemes which mix some exact exchange with density functional approximations for exchange and correlation. It is shown that the biggest errors in the atomization energies occur when there is a strong interaction between different electron pairs, which vanishes upon atomization. We argue that the amount of exchange character of a molecular property, such as the atomization energy, depends on the property itself. We define an exact mixing coefficient b, which measures this exchange character, and show that both LSD and PW91 typically overestimate this quantity. Thus, nonempirical hybrid schemes which approximate this quantity by its LSD or PW91 value typically do not improve the exchange–correlation energy. {\textcopyright} 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

In this paper, we systematically investigate the adsorption energy and diffusion coefficient of the lithium and sodium ions in monolayer and bulk VS2 for lithium and sodium ion batteries by a density functional theory method. Our calculations show that the VS2 capacity can reach up to 466 mA h g(-1). It exhibits a low output voltage of 0.72 and 0.48 V for lithium and sodium ion batteries in the monolayer VS2 as well as an output voltage of 0.88 and 0.6 V in the bulk VS2, respectively. The calculated lithium and sodium ion diffusion coefficients in the bulk VS2 are enhanced by five and seven orders of magnitude compared to the reported bulk MoS2, respectively. Our investigations also reveal that VS2 exhibits better electrochemical performance as an anode in the sodium ion battery than in the lithium ion battery.},

Contrary to conventional knowledge in the field, all metals studied are capable of producing methane or methanol. We quantify reaction rates for these two products and describe catalyst activity and selectivity in the framework of CO binding energies for the different metals. While selectivity toward methane or methanol is low for most of these metals, the fact that they are all capable of producing these products, even at a low rate, is important new knowledge.

abstract = {We present a first-principles theory of the quasiparticle energies in semiconductors and insulators described in terms of the electron self-energy operator. The full dielectric matrix is used to evaluate the self-energy operator in the GW approximation: the first term in an expansion of the self-energy operator in terms of the dynamically screened Coulomb interaction (W) and the dressed Green's function (G). Quasiparticle energies are calculated for the homopolar materials diamond, Si, and Ge as well as for the ionic compound LiCl. The results are in excellent agreement with available experimental data. In particular, the indirect band gap is calculated as 5.5, 1.29, and 0.75 eV as compared with experimental gaps of 5.48, 1.17, and 0.744 eV for diamond, Si, and Ge, respectively. The Ge results include relativistic effects. The calculated direct gap for LiCl is within 5% of experiment. Viewed as a correction to the density-functional eigenvalues calculated with the local-density approximation, the present results show a correction dominated by a large jump at the gap. It is found that because of the charge inhomogeneity, the full dielectric screening matrix must be included, i.e., local-field effects are essential. The dynamical effects are also found to be crucial. The required dielectric matrices are obtained within the density-functional approach for the static case and extended to finite frequency with use of a generalized plasmon-pole model based on sum rules. The model reproduces the $\omega$ and $\omega$-1 moments of the exact many-body response function. The qualitative features of the electron self-energy operator are discussed. Using the static Coulomb-hole–screened-exchange approximation for illustration, the role of local fields in the self-energy operator are explained. The role of dynamical renormalization is illustrated. The same qualitative features are observed in both the homopolar and ionic materials.},

First-principles calculations have emerged as a powerful approach that complements experiments and can serve as a predictive tool in the identification and characterization of defects. The theoretical modeling of point defects in crystalline materials by means of electronic-structure calculations, with an emphasis on approaches based on density functional theory (DFT), is reviewed. A general thermodynamic formalism is laid down to investigate the physical properties of point defects independent of the materials class (semiconductors, insulators, and metals), indicating how the relevant thermodynamic quantities, such as formation energy, entropy, and excess volume, can be obtained from electronic structure calculations. Practical aspects such as the supercell approach and efficient strategies to extrapolate to the isolated-defect or dilute limit are discussed. Recent advances in tractable approximations to the exchange-correlation functional (DFT+U, hybrid functionals) and approaches beyond DFT are highlighted. These advances have largely removed the long-standing uncertainty of defect formation energies in semiconductors and insulators due to the failure of standard DFT to reproduce band gaps. Two case studies illustrate how such calculations provide new insight into the physics and role of point defects in real materials.},

Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)] is a promising approach for including dispersion in approximate density functional theory exchange-correlation functionals. Indeed, an improved description of systems held by dispersion forces has been demonstrated in the literature. However, despite many applications, standard general tests on a broad range of materials including traditional "hard" matter such asmetals, ionic compounds, and insulators are lacking. Such tests are important not least because many of the applications of the vdW-DF method focus on the adsorption of atoms and molecules on the surfaces of solids. Here we calculate the lattice constants, bulk moduli, and atomization energies for a range of solids using the original vdW-DF and several of its offspring. We find that the original vdW-DF overestimates lattice constants in a similar manner to how it overestimates binding distances for gas-phase dimers. However, some of the modified vdW functionals lead to average errors which are similar to those of PBE or better. Likewise, atomization energies that are slightly better than from PBE are obtained from the modified vdW-DFs. Although the tests reported here are for hard solids, not normally materials for which dispersion forces are thought to be important, we find a systematic improvement in cohesive properties for the alkali metals and alkali halides when nonlocal correlations are accounted for.},

Concurrently, the availability of 2D materials has provided ideal samples in which each atom or vacancy can be resolved. New possibilities for the application of focused electron irradiation are being revealed, namely, the controlled manipulation of structures and even individual atoms. Evaluating the full range of possibilities for this method requires precise understanding of the electron–matter interactions, which is becoming feasible owing to advances in both experimental techniques and theoretical models. In this Perspective, we summarize the state of knowledge of the underlying physical processes on the basis of the latest results on 2D materials, with a focus on the physical principles of electron–matter interactions rather than material-specific irradiation-induced defects. Two-dimensional materials could provide the experimental guidance for the development of quantitative models applicable to a wide range of materials.},

Specifically, corrections to a Keplerian orbit due to special relativity include: precession of perihelion, reduced radius of circular orbit, and increased eccentricity. The prediction for the rate of precession of perihelion of Mercury is in agreement with existing calculations using only special relativity, and is one sixth that derived from general relativity. All three of these corrections are qualitatively correct, though suppressed when compared to the more accurate general-relativistic corrections in this limit. The resulting orbit equation has the same form as that derived from general relativity and is easily compared to that describing Kepler's orbits. This treatment of the relativistic central-mass problem is complementary to other solutions to the relativistic Kepler problem, and is approachable by undergraduate physics majors whom have not had a course dedicated to relativity.},

At temperatures above 50% of the melt temperature, mass transport occurs across the layer interface and rapid diffusion is observed in the topmost atomic layers, resulting in liquidlike behavior in a thin layer over ordered crystal.},

We further image how this leads to a strong in-plane anisotropy of the electronic structure, with quasi-one-dimensional bands reflecting predominant hopping along zig-zag Re chains. We find that this does not persist up to the top of the valence band, where a more three-dimensional character is recovered with the fundamental band gap located away from the Brillouin zone centre along $k_z$.

@article{Grimme2010,
abstract = {The method of dispersion correction as an add-on to standard Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT-D) has been refined regarding higher accuracy, broader range of applicability, and less empiricism. The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15%-40% compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C(6) coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10%) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with DFT and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems.},

abstract = {CdTe quantum dots have unique characteristics that are promising for applications in photoluminescence, photovoltaics or optoelectronics. However, wide variations of the reported quantum yields exist and the influence of ligand-surface interactions that are expected to control the excited state relaxation processes remains unknown. It is important to thoroughly understand the fundamental principles underlying these relaxation processes to tailor the QDs properties to their application. Here, we systematically investigate the roles of the surface atoms, ligand functional groups and solvent on the radiative and non-radiative relaxation rates. Combining a systematic synthetic approach with X-ray photoelectron, quantitative FT-IR and time-resolved visible spectroscopies, we find that CdTe QDs can be engineered with average radiative lifetimes ranging from nanoseconds up to microseconds. The non-radiative lifetimes are anticorrelated to the radiative lifetimes, although they show much less variation. The density, nature and orientation of the ligand functional groups and the dielectric constant of the solvent play major roles in determining charge carrier trapping and excitonic relaxation pathways. These results are used to propose a coupled dependence between hole-trapping on Te atoms and strong ligand coupling, primarily via Cd atoms, that can be used to engineer both the radiative and non-radiative lifetimes.},

abstract = {We have studied the epitaxial growth of silicon using molecular-dynamics techniques. The model consists of a temperature-controlled Si(111) substrate, with the Si atoms projected towards the substrate as is done in the laboratory. The atoms interact via a potential developed by Stillinger and Weber to simulate the bulk properties of Si. We find that at low substrate temperatures the growth is not well ordered; this is in accordance with experimental observation. It is precisely the opposite of what occurs in spherically symmetric potentials that were used to simulate the growth of metallic films. At higher substrate temperatures the growth is into properly stacked, crystalline Si layers. In contrast to the growth of metals (spherically symmetric potentials), the atomic mobility on the growing surface and the thermal conductivity of the system are much lower for Si; the results of this simulation and those of our previous work are in agreement with experimental observations showing, as expected, that a major determining factor in epitaxial growth of films is the nature of the interaction potential.},

abstract = {Linear scaling relationships between the adsorption energies of CO2 reduction intermediates pose a fundamental limitation to the catalytic efficiency of transition-metal catalysts. Significant improvements in CO2 reduction activity beyond transition metals require the stabilization of key intermediates, COOH* and CHO* or COH*, independent of CO*. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that the doped sulfur edge of MoS2 satisfies this requirement by binding CO* significantly weaker than COOH*, CHO*, and COH*, relative to transition-metal surfaces. The structural basis for the scaling of doped sulfur edge of MoS2 is due to CO* binding on the metallic site (doping metal) and COOH*, CHO*, and COH* on the covalent site (sulfur). Linear scaling relations still exist if all the intermediates bind to the same site, but the combined effect of the two binding sites results in an overall deviation from transition-metal scaling lines. This principle can be applied to other metal/p-block materials. We rationalize the weak binding of CO* on the sulfur site with distortion/interaction and charge density difference analyses.},

abstract = {MoS2 is a layered two-dimensional semiconductor with a direct band gap of 1.8 eV. The MoS2/bulk semiconductor system offers a new platform for solar cell device design. Different from the conventional bulk p-n junctions, in the MoS2/bulk semiconductor heterostructure, static charge transfer shifts the Fermi level of MoS2 toward that of bulk semiconductor, lowering the barrier height of the formed junction. Herein, we introduce hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) into MoS2/GaAs heterostructure to suppress the static charge transfer, and the obtained MoS2/h-BN/GaAs solar cell exhibits an improved power conversion efficiency of 5.42%. More importantly, the sandwiched h-BN makes the Fermi level tuning of MoS2 more effective. By employing chemical doping and electrical gating into the solar cell device, PCE of 9.03% is achieved, which is the highest among all the reported monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide based solar cells.},

abstract = {We report field electron emission investigations on pulsed laser-deposited molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) thin films on W-tip and Si substrates. In both cases, under the chosen growth conditions, the dry process of pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is seen to render a dense nanostructured morphology of MoS2, which is important for local electric field enhancement in field emission application. In the case of the MoS2 film on silicon (Si), the turn-on field required to draw an emission current density of 10 $\mu$A/cm(2) is found to be 2.8 V/$\mu$m. Interestingly, the MoS2 film on a tungsten (W) tip emitter delivers a large emission current density of ∼30 mA/cm(2) at a relatively lower applied voltage of ∼3.8 kV. Thus, the PLD-MoS2 can be utilized for various field emission-based applications. We also report our results of photodiode-like behavior in (n- and p- type) Si/PLD-MoS2 heterostructures. Finally we show that MoS2 films deposited on flexible kapton substrate show a good photoresponse and recovery. Our investigations thus hold great promise for the development of PLD MoS2 films in application domains such as field emitters and heterostructures for novel nanoelectronic devices.},

In the first-principle calculations performed in the density functional theory framework we implement novel functionals accounting for Van der Waals forces and employ to the test cases of graphite and graphene layers. It turns out that this approach provides a solution to the long standing problem of overbinding between graphene layers in bulk graphite, giving the distance between the carbon layers in excellent agreement with experiment. In graphene bilayers, Van der Waals functionals lead to energetic barriers for A–B to A–A ordering of graphene bilayers that are by a factor of two smaller than the barriers obtained with standard functionals. It may be of crucial importance, particularly, if one uses atomistic ab initio methods as a starting point for multi-scale modeling of materials and for determination of effective potentials.},

@article{Wang2015,
abstract = {Highly active and low-cost catalysts for electrochemical reactions such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are crucial for the development of efficient energy conversion and storage technologies. Theoretical simulations have been instrumental in revealing the correlations between the electronic structure of materials and their catalytic activity, which guide the prediction and development of improved catalysts. However, difficulties in accurately engineering the desired atomic sites lead to challenges in making direct comparisons between experimental and theoretical results. In MoS2 , the Mo-edge has been demonstrated to be active for HER whereas the S-edge is inert. Using a computational descriptor-based approach, we predict that by incorporating transition metal atoms (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu), the S-edge site should also become HER active. Vertically standing, edge- terminated MoS2 nanofilms provide a well-defined model system for verifying these predictions. The transition metal doped MoS2 nanofilms show an increase in exchange current densities by at least two-fold, in agreement with the theoretical calculations. This work opens up further opportunities for improving electrochemical catalysts by incorporating promoters into particular atomic sites, and for using well-defined systems in order to understand the origin of the promotion effects.

Atomically thin layers of group 6 transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as MoS2 and WSe2 are remarkably stable semiconductors that allow highly efficient electrostatic control due to their 2D nature. Field effect transistors (FETs) based on 2D TMDs are basic building blocks for novel electronic and chemical sensing applications. Here, we review the state-of-the-art of TMD-based FETs and summarize the current understanding of interface and surface effects that play a major role in these systems. We discuss how controlled doping is key to tailoring the electrical response of these materials and realizing high performance devices. The first part of this review focuses on some fundamental features of gate-modulated charge transport in 2D TMDs. We critically evaluate the role of surfaces and interfaces based on the data reported in the literature and explain the observed discrepancies between the experimental and theoretical values of carrier mobility. The second part introduces various non-covalent strategies for achieving desired doping in these systems. Gas sensors based on charge transfer doping and electrostatic stabilization are introduced to highlight progress in this direction. We conclude the review with an outlook on the realization of tailored TMD-based field-effect devices through surface and interface chemistry.},

abstract = {Linear scaling relations between reaction intermediates pose a fundamental limitation to the CO2 reduction activity of transition-metal catalysts. To design improved catalysts, we propose to break these scaling relations by binding key reaction intermediates to different sites. Using density functional theory, we demonstrate this principle in the active edge sites in MoS2, MoSe2, and Ni-doped MoS2. These edges show the unique property of selectively binding COOH and CHO to bridging S or Se atoms and CO to the metal atom. DFT calculations suggest a significant improvement in CO2 reduction activity over the transition metals. Our results point to the broader application of the active edge sites of transition-metal dichalcogenides in complex electrochemical processes.},

abstract = {Lead-free solution-processed solid-state photovoltaic devices based on methylammonium tin iodide (CH3NH3SnI3) perovskite semiconductor as the light harvester are reported. Featuring an optical bandgap of 1.3 eV, the CH3NH3SnI3 perovskite material can be incorporated into devices with the organic hole-transport layer spiro-OMeTAD and show an absorption onset at 950 nm, which is significantly redshifted compared with the benchmark CH3NH3PbI3 counterpart (1.55 eV). Bandgap engineering was implemented by chemical substitution in the form of CH3NH3SnI3–xBrx solid solutions, which can be controllably tuned to cover much of the visible spectrum, thus enabling the realization of lead-free solar cells with an initial power conversion efficiency of 5.73% under simulated full sunlight. Further efficiency enhancements are expected following optimization and a better fundamental understanding of the internal electron dynamics and corresponding interfacial engineering. The reported CH3NH3SnI3–xBrx perovskite solar cells represent a step towards the realization of low-cost, environmentally friendly solid-state solar cells.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2017 American Physical Society. Classical molecular dynamics calculations were used to investigate the formation of defects produced during irradiation of energetic ions on silicon. The aim of this study was to characterize the nature of defects and defective regions formed through ion irradiation and to establish a connection between the ion irradiation parameters, lattice defect configurations, and the resulting modified lattice thermal conductivity of silicon. The defective regions were characterized according to the total number of defects generated, the size and the density of the defective region, and the longitudinal and radial distribution of defects along the ion impact path. In addition, the clustering of the defects into amorphous pockets is analyzed and the effect of these processing parameters on the properties of the clusters is also studied. Further, the lattice defect configurations produced during continuous bombardment of multiple ions are directly investigated and compared to the single-ion impact results. A range of irradiation parameters including ion species, ion energies, fluence, and beam width have been explored to elucidate the dependence of the resulting defect configurations on these experimental design parameters. High density defective regions are found to be produced by low-energy ions with high atomic number. Analysis of the defects produced under varying beam diameters indicates that the beam diameter, rather than the beam energy, is the more prominent factor in determining the extent of the defective region. We demonstrate that the thermal conductivity of the material is most significantly influenced by the effective diameter of the defective region, making the beam diameter the most influential experimental parameter for tuning the lattice thermal conductivity. A reduction in thermal conductivity of up to 80% from pristine silicon was achieved with the processing parameters used in this work. This study indicates that ion beam irradiation can be a realizable manufacturing process with high tunability and control to achieve desired material properties.},

abstract = {We show that inversion symmetry breaking together with spin-orbit coupling leads to coupled spin and valley physics in monolayers of MoS2 and other group-VI dichalcogenides, making possible controls of spin and valley in these 2D materials. The spin-valley coupling at the valence-band edges suppresses spin and valley relaxation, as flip of each index alone is forbidden by the valley-contrasting spin splitting. Valley Hall and spin Hall effects coexist in both electron-doped and hole-doped systems. Optical interband transitions have frequency-dependent polarization selection rules which allow selective photoexcitation of carriers with various combination of valley and spin indices. Photoinduced spin Hall and valley Hall effects can generate long lived spin and valley accumulations on sample boundaries. The physics discussed here provides a route towards the integration of valleytronics and spintronics in multivalley materials with strong spin-orbit coupling and inversion symmetry breaking.},

Although significant progress has been made on 2D nanomaterials for LIB applications in the recent years, some major challenges still exist for the direct use of these sheet-like nanomaterials, such as their serious self-agglomerating tendency during electrode fabrication and low conductivity as well as the large volume changes over repeated charging-discharging cycles for most TMOs/TMDs, which have resulted in large irreversible capacity, low initial Coulombic efficiency, and fast capacity fading. To address these issues, considerable progress has been made in the exploitation of 2D nanosheets for enhanced lithium storage. In this review, we intend to summarize the recent progress on the strategies for enhancing the lithium storage performance of 2D nanomaterials, including hybridization with conductive materials, surface/edge functionalization, and structural optimization. These strategies for manipulating the structures and properties of 2D nanomaterials are expected to meet the grand challenges for advanced nanomaterials in clean energy applications and thus provide access to exciting materials for achieving high-performance next-generation energy storage devices.},

They offer a number of advantages: they are very general and applicable to systems as different as small molecules, semiconductors and metals; they are numerically very accurate and fast to evaluate; and they can be constructed using any electronic structure method.

abstract = {Protecting organohalide perovskite thin films from water and ambient humidity represents a paramount challenge for the commercial uptake of perovskite solar cells and, in general, of related optoelectronic devices. Therefore, understanding the perovskite/water interface is of crucial importance. As a step in this direction, here we present ab initio molecular dynamics simulations aimed at unraveling the atomistic details of the interaction between the methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI 3) perovskite surfaces and a liquid water environment. According to our calculations, MAI-terminated surfaces undergo a rapid solvation process, driven by the interaction of water molecules with Pb atoms, which prompts the release of I atoms. PbI 2 -terminated surfaces, instead, seem to be more robust to degradation, by virtue of the stronger (shorter) Pb−I bonds formed on these facets. We also observe the incorporation of a water molecule into the PbI 2 -terminated slab, which could represent the first step in the formation of an intermediate hydrated phase. Interestingly, PbI 2 defects on the PbI 2 -terminated surface promote the rapid dissolution of the exposed facet. Surface hydration, which is spontaneous for both MAI-and PbI 2 -terminated slabs, does not modify the electronic landscape of the former, while the local band gap of the PbI 2 -exposing model widens by ∼0.3 eV in the interfacial region. Finally, we show that water incorporation into bulk MAPbI 3 produces almost no changes in the tetragonal structure of the perovskite crystal (∼1% volume expansion) but slightly opens the band gap. We believe that this work, unraveling some of the atomistic details of the perovskite/water interface, may inspire new interfacial modifications and device architectures with increased stabilities, which could in turn assist the commercial uptake of perovskite solar cells and optoelectronic devices.},

The reaction of the BaZrO3−CS2 system was extremely rapid, as would be expected in an autocatalytic reaction caused by very strong reduction by CS2. Well-sintered bodies were obtained only by the BaZrO3−CS2 reaction. The time dependence of grain growth was affected considerably when reaction and sintering occurred above 1250° C. Non-uniform grain growth which occurs when an excess of Ba is present can be interpreted in terms of secondary recrystallization resulting from segregation of BaS at the grain boundary during sintering. The BaZrS3 ceramic was stable in air up to 550°C and was oxidized above that temperature.},

Advances in imaging technology in the beginning of the twenty-first century have opened the proverbial floodgates on the availability of high-veracity information on structure and functionality. From the hardware perspective, high-resolution imaging methods now routinely resolve atomic positions with approximately picometer precision, allowing for quantitative measurements of individual bond lengths and angles. Similarly, functional imaging often leads to multidimensional data sets containing partial or full information on properties of interest, acquired as a function of multiple parameters (time, temperature, or other external stimuli).

Slow decompression of crystalline benzene in large-volume high-pressure cells has recently achieved synthesis of a novel one-dimensional allotrope of sp3 carbon in which stacked columns of benzene molecules rehybridize into an ordered crystal of nanothreads. The progenitor benzene molecules function as six-valent one-dimensional superatoms with multiple binding sites. Here we enumerate their hexavalent bonding geometries, recognizing that the repeat unit of interatomic connectivity (topological unit cell) need not coincide with the crystallographic unit cell, and identify the most energetically favorable cases. A topological unit cell of one or two benzene rings with at least two bonds interconnecting each adjacent pair of rings, accommodates 50 topologically distinct nanothreads, 15 of which are within 80 meV/carbon atom of the most stable member. Optimization of aperiodic helicity reveals the most stable structures to be chiral. We generalize Eulers rules for ring counting to cover this new form of very thin one-dimensional carbon, calculated their physical properties, and propose a naming convention that can be generalized to handle nanothreads formed from other progenitor molecules.},

@article{Beattie1959,
abstract = {This paper presents a calculation of the lifetimes ($\tau$) of excess electrons and holes in a semiconductor aaanming the Auger effect between bands (electron-electron and hole-hole collisions) to be the only recombination mechanism. If pair annihilation, and the corresponding reverse process of pair creation, are counted separately, there are four classes of processes to be considered. The suitably weighted algebraic sum of the rates of these processes yields a net recombination rate R. If N be the non-equilibrium number of pairs, then $\tau$ = N/R . In the calculation the effect of traps is neglected, and the group of electrons in the conduction band and the group in the valence band are each assumed to be in equilibrium among themselves, but not with each other, by the use of quasi-Fermi levels. Bloch functions $\psi$k = u(k, r) exp (ik.r) are used. The matrix element of the Coulomb interaction is obtained as a multiple sum over reciprocal lattice vectors. Most of these terms correspond to Umklapp-type processes whose probability of occurrence is shown to be small. The dominant term, after integration over all initial and final states, yields the dependence of lifetime on temperature, carrier concentration, energy gap and other parameters. The absolute value of the lifetime depends also on an overlap intergral of the form Su*(k, r) u(k', r) dr where k, k' are in different bands. This integral is estimated on the basis of a one-dimensional model. The theory is compared with experimental lifetimes in InSb, and shows that the mechanism envisaged may dominate radiative recombination above 240 °K and accounts for the order of magnitude of the observed lifetimes ($\sim$ 10-8 s) in the neighbourhood of the highest temperature (330 °K) at which recombination in InSb has so far been studied.},

abstract = {We report on measurements of the stiffness and breaking strength of monolayer MoS(2), a new semiconducting analogue of graphene. Single and bilayer MoS(2) is exfoliated from bulk and transferred to a substrate containing an array of microfabricated circular holes. The resulting suspended, free-standing membranes are deformed and eventually broken using an atomic force microscope. We find that the in-plane stiffness of monolayer MoS(2) is 180 +/- 60 Nm(-1), corresponding to an effective Young's modulus of 270 +/- 100 GPa, which is comparable to that of steel. Breaking occurs at an effective strain between 6 and 11% with the average breaking strength of 15 +/- 3 Nm(-1) (23 GPa). The strength of strongest monolayer membranes is 11% of its Young's modulus, corresponding to the upper theoretical limit which indicates that the material can be highly crystalline and almost defect-free. Our results show that monolayer MoS(2) could be suitable for a variety of applications such as reinforcing elements in composites and for fabrication of flexible electronic devices.},

abstract = {Organic-inorganic halide perovskites are intrinsically unstable when exposed to moisture and/or light. Additionally, the presence of lead in many perovskites raises toxicity concerns. Herein is reported a thin film of BaZrS3, a lead-free chalcogenide perovskite. Photoluminescence and X-ray diffraction measurements show that BaZrS3 is far more stable than methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) in moist environments. Moisture- and light-induced degradations in BaZrS3 and MAPbI3 are compared by using simulations and calculations based on density functional theory. The simulations reveal drastically slower degradation in BaZrS3 due to two factors - weak interaction with water, and very low rates of ion migration. BaZrS3 photo-detecting devices with photo-responsivity of $\sim$46.5 mA W-1 are also reported. The devices retain $\sim$60% of their initial photo-response after 4 weeks in ambient conditions. Similar MAPbI3 devices degrade rapidly and show $\sim$95% decrease in photo-responsivity in just 4 days. The findings establish the superior stability of BaZrS3 and strengthen the case for its use in optoelectronics. New possibilities for thermoelectric energy conversion using these materials are also demonstrated.},

abstract = {Present local and semilocal functionals show significant errors, for instance, in the energetics of small molecules and in the description of band gaps. One possible solution to these problems is the introduction of exact exchange and hybrid functionals. A plane-wave-based algorithm was implemented in VASP (Vienna ab-initio simulation package) to allow for the calculation of the exact exchange. To systematically assess the precision of the present implementation, calculations for the 55 molecules of the G2-1 quantum chemical test set were performed applying the PBE and PBE0 functionals. Excellent agreement for both atomization energies and geometries compared with the results obtained by GAUSSIAN 03 calculations using large basis sets (augmented correlation consistent polarized valence quadruple zeta for the geometry optimization and augmented correlation-consistent polarized valence quintuple zeta for the energy calculations) was found. The mean absolute error for atomization energies between VASP and the experiment is 8.6 and 3.7 kcalmol, as calculated with the PBE and PBE0 functionals, respectively. The mean deviations between VASP and GAUSSIAN are 0.46 and 0.49 kcalmol for the PBE and PBE0 functionals, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

A strong dependence of quantum transport on MoS2orientation is predicted. To a large extent, the orientation dependence is due to subband transport properties and the atomistic structure along the transport direction. A bandgap is found in the conduction band along armchair direction (AD), which plays a major role for the orientation-dependent transport. At the same time, different atomic arrangements along AD and zigzag direction have different depletion region lengths, which also contribute to the orientation-dependent transport. Orientation dependence of drain current exists in MoS2FETs having different gate lengths.},

abstract = {A methodology for coupling multiple length scales in chemical vapor deposition processes is presented. A reactor scale model (RSM), used for the description of the macro-scale in the bulk, is coupled with a feature scale model (FSM), used for the description of the topography evolution of the micro-scale features (e.g. trenches or holes) on the wafer. The RSM is implemented with a commercial package and the FSM is implemented by combining a ballistic model for the transport and a profile evolution algorithm based on the level set method. The coupling of the RSM with the FSM is performed through the correction of the boundary condition for the species consumption along the wafer. Essentially, the pre-exponential factor of the Arrhenius expression for the surface reaction(s) is locally corrected along the wafer and this correction allows taking into account the micro-topography on the wafer without including it in the computational domain of the RSM. The coupling methodology implements flow of information in both directions, i.e. from the RSM to the FSM and backwards. Tungsten deposition from tungsten hexafluoride and hydrogen is the case studied. The reactor is axisymmetric and the wafer includes a series of trenches with dimensions at the micro-scale. The effect of the deposition time and the density (number) of trenches on the wafer on (a) the species' consumption on the wafer and (b) the trench profile evolution is investigated. The loading phenomenon, i.e. the depletion of reactants due to their increased consumption on the micro-topography on the wafer surface is predicted. The importance of the feedback from the micro-scale (to the macro-scale) is demonstrated by comparing trench profiles produced with and without feedback. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We study the atomic scale microstructure of nonstoichiometric two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide MoSe2-x by employing aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. We show that a Se-deficit in single layers of MoSe2 grown by molecular beam epitaxy gives rise to a dense network of mirror-twin-boundaries (MTBs) decorating the 2D-grains. With the use of density functional theory calculations, we further demonstrate that MTBs are thermodynamically stable structures in Se-deficient sheets. These line defects host spatially localized states with energies close to the valence band minimum, thus giving rise to enhanced conductance along straight MTBs. However, electronic transport calculations show that the transmission of hole charge carriers across MTBs is strongly suppressed due to band bending effects. We further observe formation of MTBs during in situ removal of Se atoms by the electron beam of the microscope, thus confirming that MTBs appear due to Se-deficit, and not coalescence of individual grains during growth. At a very high local Se-deficit, the 2D sheet becomes unstable and transforms to a nanowire.

abstract = {A linear stability analysis is applied to the study of the compact-fractal island morphological transition during epitaxial growth. The analysis includes the diffusion mediated interaction between islands within a self-consistent mean-field theory. A scaling form is derived for the length of the island edges. Results are confirmed by comparison with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. PACS numbers: 61.43.Hv, 82.20.Mj Single atom high islands which form during the early stages (submonolayer) of epitaxial growth exhibit mor-phologies which range from ramified structures to com-pact polygonal shapes. For example, scanning tunneling microscopy images of Au on Ru(0001) grown at room temperature reveal fractal islands. Deposition of Co on the same substrate produces compact triangular islands [1]. Similarly, ramified islands are observed for Pt on Pt at low temperature, and compact islands are found for higher temperatures [2]. In this work the dependence of the island morphologies on externally controlled growth parameters is addressed. It is important to understand this dependence, since these islands form the template upon which all further growth proceeds [3]. The observation of ramified island growth has been understood [1] by comparison with the simplest "hit and stick" model of diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) [4]. In this model, a particle diffuses on the substrate to an island from far away and sticks at the first point of contact with the cluster. The fractal dimension for a DLA cluster is identical to that measured for islands of Au on Ru(0001) [1]. However, the growth of islands during epitaxy differs from DLA in two very important respects: (1) Atoms which diffuse to the island relax to a lower energy site, e.g. , by diffusion along the edge of the island (edge diffusion). As the rate of relaxation increases relative to the rate at which atoms diffuse Io the island, a morphological transition occurs from ramified island growth to compact island growth. For an isolated island this competition is well understood [5,6]. (2) The islands grow in the presence of other islands on the surface and, therefore, compete for the available diffusing monomers. The effects of this complication on the island morphology are not yet well understood. In fact, there is disagreement in recent literature [7 — 9] as to the dependence of the transition on the growth parameters. In this paper, the morphological transition is studied by considering the shape stability of a compact island. A linear stability analysis, similar to that applied to the study of the Mullins-Sekerka instability [10], is used to study the stability of a circular island with respect to infinitesimal morphological fluctuations. In contrast to a traditional stability analysis [5,11], the environment surrounding any particular island on the surface is changing with time during the growth process, due to the presence of the other islands. In this work, therefore, the stability analysis is combined with a self-consistent mean-field theory which describes accurately average properties of the entire surface [12]. Based on this novel approach and the results of kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations a new scaling law is formulated, and the disagreements in the literature reconciled. During the growth process, a competition develops between the nucleation of new islands on the substrate and the capture of monomers by already existing islands. This competition leads to a simple relation between the average distance between islands 4, the deposition flux F, and the monomer diffusion constant D, namely, where the exponent y depends on the critical nucleus size [13]. The current work focuses on irreversible growth in which a dimer is stable and g = 1/6. Similarly, it is shown here that the balance of the competing effects of ramified growth and smoothing by edge diffusion also leads to a simple scaling form. Near the transition to ramified island growth the fraction n, of deposited atoms that are at the edge of an island obeys n where I measures the rate at which atoms diffuse around the edge of the island and f is the scaling function. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations based on simple energetics provide a useful tool to investigate scaling relationships such as Eqs. (1) and (2). The current simulations are performed on a square lattice. The monomers hop on the bare substrate at a rate of hD = ve t'$\sim$', where v is the attempt frequency, P is the reciprocal temperature, and F, is the energy barrier to monomer diffusion on the substrate (note that D = ho/4). Attachment of monomers to other monomers and existing islands is assumed irreversible.},

A formal matched asymptotic analysis is performed to show the reduction of the phase-field model to the classical sharp interface BurtonCabreraFrank model for step flow when the interfacial thickness vanishes. The phase-field model is solved by a semi-implicit finite difference scheme, and adaptive block-structured Cartesian meshes are used to dramatically increase the efficiency of the solver. The numerical scheme is used to investigate the evolution of perturbed circularly shaped small islands. The effect of edge diffusion is investigated together with the EhrlichSchwoebel barrier. We also investigate the linear and nonlinear regimes of a step meandering instability. We reproduce the predicted scaling law for the growth of the meander amplitude, which was based on an analysis of a long wavelength regime. New nonlinear behavior is observed when the meander wavelength is comparable to the terrace width. In particular, a previously unobserved regime of coarsening dynamics is found to occur when the meander wavelength is comparable to the terrace width. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This is achieved by combining the Tkatchenko-Scheffler van der Waals (vdW) method [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 073005 (2009)] with the self-consistent screening equation of classical electrodynamics. This leads to a seamless description of polarization and depolarization for the polarizability tensor of molecules and solids. The screened long-range many-body vdW energy is obtained from the solution of the Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation for a system of coupled oscillators. We show that the screening and the many-body vdW energy play a significant role even for rather small molecules, becoming crucial for an accurate treatment of conformational energies for biomolecules and binding of molecular crystals. The computational cost of the developed theory is negligible compared to the underlying electronic structure calculation.},

abstract = {A key quantity for molecule-metal interfaces is the energy level alignment of molecular electronic states with the metallic Fermi level. We develop and apply an efficient theoretical method, based on density functional theory (DFT) that can yield quantitatively accurate energy level alignment information for physisorbed metal?molecule interfaces. The method builds on the ?DFT+$\Sigma$? approach, grounded in many-body perturbation theory, which introduces an approximate electron self-energy that corrects the level alignment obtained from conventional DFT for missing exchange and correlation effects associated with the gas-phase molecule and substrate polarization. Here, we extend the DFT+$\Sigma$ approach in two important ways: first, we employ optimally tuned range-separated hybrid functionals to compute the gas-phase term, rather than rely on GW or total energy differences as in prior work; second, we use a nonclassical DFT-determined image-charge plane of the metallic surface to compute the substrate polarization term, rather than the classical DFT-derived image plane used previously. We validate this new approach by a detailed comparison with experimental and theoretical reference data for several prototypical molecule?metal interfaces, where excellent agreement with experiment is achieved: benzene on graphite (0001), and 1,4-benzenediamine, Cu-phthalocyanine, and 3,4,9,10-perylene-tetracarboxylic-dianhydride on Au(111). In particular, we show that the method correctly captures level alignment trends across chemical systems and that it retains its accuracy even for molecules for which conventional DFT suffers from severe self-interaction errors.},

The hybrid model combines a partial first principles model, which incorporates the available prior knowledge about the process being modeled, with a neural network which serves as an estimator of unmeasuredprocess parameters that are difficult to model from first principles. This hybrid model has better properties than standard " black-box " neural network models in that it is able to interpolate and extrapolate much more accurately, is easier to analyze and in-terpret, and requires significantly fewer training examples. Two alternative state and parameter estimation strategies, extended Kalman filtering and NLP optimization, are also considered. When no a priori known model of the unobserved process parameters is available, the hybrid network model gives better estimates of the parameters, when compared to these methods. By providing a model of these un-measured parameters, the hybrid network can also make predictions and hence can be used for process optimization. These results apply both when full and partial state measurements are available, but in the latter case a state reconstruction method must be used for the first principles component of the hybrid model.},

abstract = {The reactive force-ﬁeld (ReaxFF) interatomic potential is a powerful computational tool for exploring, developing and optimizing material properties. Methods based on the principles of quantum mechanics (QM), while offering valuable theoretical guidance at the electronic level, are often too computationally intense for simulations that consider the full dynamic evolution of a system. Alternatively, empirical interatomic potentials that are based on classical principles require signiﬁcantly fewer computational resources, which enables simulations to better describe dynamic processes over longer timeframes and on larger scales. Such methods, however, typically require a predeﬁned connectivity between atoms, precluding simulations that involve reactive events. The ReaxFF method was developed to help bridge this gap. Approaching the gap from the classical side, ReaxFF casts the empirical interatomic potential within a bond-order formalism, thus implicitly describing chemical bonding without expensive QM calculations. This article provides an overview of the development, application, and future directions of the ReaxFF method.},

The effects of CH(4) partial pressure, growth temperature, and H(2)/CH(4) ratio were investigated and growth conditions optimized. The formation of monolayer graphene was shown by Raman spectroscopy, optical transmission, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), and low voltage transmission electron microscopy (LVTEM). Electrical analysis revealed that a room temperature Hall mobility above 2000 cm(2)/V{\textperiodcentered}s was achieved, and the mobility and carrier type were correlated to growth conditions. Both GIXRD and LVTEM studies confirm a dominant crystal orientation (principally graphene [10-10] || sapphire [11-20]) for about 80-90% of the material concomitant with epitaxial growth. The initial phase of the nucleation and the lateral growth from the nucleation seeds were observed using atomic force microscopy. The initial nuclei density was $\sim$24 $\mu$m(-2), and a lateral growth rate of $\sim$82 nm/min was determined. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the binding between graphene and sapphire is dominated by weak dispersion interactions and indicate that the epitaxial relation as observed by GIXRD is due to preferential binding of small molecules on sapphire during early stages of graphene formation.},

abstract = {In this work, we developed an interatomic potential for saturated hydrocarbons using the modified embedded-atom method (MEAM), a reactive semi-empirical many-body potential based on density functional theory and pair potentials. We parameterized the potential by fitting to a large experimental and first-principles (FP) database consisting of (1) bond distances, bond angles, and atomization energies at 0 K of a homologous series of alkanes and their select isomers from methane to n-octane, (2) the potential energy curves of H2, CH, and C2 diatomics, (3) the potential energy curves of hydrogen, methane, ethane, and propane dimers, i.e., (H2)2, (CH4)2, (C2H6)2, and (C3H8)2, respectively, and (4) pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) data of a dense high-pressure methane system with the density of 0.5534 g cc(-1). We compared the atomization energies and geometries of a range of linear alkanes, cycloalkanes, and free radicals calculated from the MEAM potential to those calculated by other commonly used reactive potentials for hydrocarbons, i.e., second-generation reactive empirical bond order (REBO) and reactive force field (ReaxFF). MEAM reproduced the experimental and/or FP data with accuracy comparable to or better than REBO or ReaxFF. The experimental PVT data for a relatively large series of methane, ethane, propane, and butane systems with different densities were predicted reasonably well by the MEAM potential. Although the MEAM formalism has been applied to atomic systems with predominantly metallic bonding in the past, the current work demonstrates the promising extension of the MEAM potential to covalently bonded molecular systems, specifically saturated hydrocarbons and saturated hydrocarbon-based polymers. The MEAM potential has already been parameterized for a large number of metallic unary, binary, ternary, carbide, nitride, and hydride systems, and extending it to saturated hydrocarbons provides a reliable and transferable potential for atomistic/molecular studies of complex material phenomena involving hydrocarbon-metal or polymer-metal interfaces, polymer-metal nanocomposites, fracture and failure in hydrocarbon-based polymers, etc. The latter is especially true since MEAM is a reactive potential that allows for dynamic bond formation and bond breaking during simulation. Our results show that MEAM predicts the energetics of two major chemical reactions for saturated hydrocarbons, i.e., breaking a C-C and a C-H bond, reasonably well. However, the current parameterization does not accurately reproduce the energetics and structures of unsaturated hydrocarbons and, therefore, should not be applied to such systems.},

Largely, this progress was enabled by computer-assisted methods of microscope operation, data acquisition, and analysis. Advances in imaging technology in the beginning of the twenty-first century have opened the proverbial floodgates on the availability of high-veracity information on structure and functionality. From the hardware perspective, high-resolution imaging methods now routinely resolve atomic positions with approximately picometer precision, allowing for quantitative measurements of individual bond lengths and angles. Similarly, functional imaging often leads to multidimensional data sets containing partial or full information on properties of interest, acquired as a function of multiple parameters (time, temperature, or other external stimuli).

@article{Heine2015,
abstract = {Conspectus After the discovery of graphene and the development of powerful exfoliation techniques, experimental preparation of two-dimensional (2D) crystals can be expected for any layered material that is known to chemistry. Besides graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), transition metal chalcogenides (TMC) are among the most studied ultrathin materials. In particular, single-layer MoS2, a direct band gap semiconductor with ∼1.9 eV energy gap, is popular in physics and nanoelectronics, because it nicely complements semimetallic graphene and insulating h-BN monolayer as a construction component for flexible 2D electronics and because it was already successfully applied in the laboratory as basis material for transistors and other electronic and optoelectronic devices. Two-dimensional crystals are subject to significant quantum confinement: compared with their parent layered 3D material, they show different structural, electronic, and optical properties, such as spontaneous rippling as free-standing monolayer, significant changes of the electronic band structure, giant spin-orbit splitting, and enhanced photoluminescence. Most of those properties are intrinsic for the monolayer and already absent for two-layer stacks of the same 2D crystal. For example, single-layer MoS2 is a direct band gap semiconductor with spin-orbit splitting of 150 meV in the valence band, while the bilayer of the same material is an indirect band gap semiconductor without observable spin-orbit splitting. All these properties have been observed experimentally and are in excellent agreement with calculations based on density-functional theory. This Account reports theoretical studies of a subgroup of transition metal dichalcogenides with the composition MX2, with M = Mo, or W and X = Se or S, also referred to as "MoWSeS materials". Results on the electronic structure, quantum confinement, spin-orbit coupling, spontaneous monolayer rippling, and change of electronic properties in the presence of an external electric field are reported. While all materials of the MoWSeS family share the same qualitative properties, their individual values can differ strongly, for example, the spin-orbit splitting in WSe2 reaches the value of 428 meV, nearly three times that of MoS2. Further, we discuss the effect of strain on the electronic properties (straintronics). While MoWSeS single layers are very robust against external electric fields, bilayers show a linear reduction of the band gap, even reaching a semiconductor-metal phase transition, and an increase of the spin-orbit splitting from zero to the monolayer value at rather small fields. Strain is yet another possibility to control the band gap in a linear way, and MoWSeS monolayers become metallic at strain values of ∼10%. The density-functional based tight-binding model is a useful tool to investigate the electronic and structural properties, including electron conductance, of large MoS2 structures, which show spontaneous rippling in finite-temperature molecular dynamics simulations. Structural defects in MoS2 result in anisotropy of the electric conductivity. Finally, DFT predictions on the properties of noble metal dichalcogenides are presented. Most strikingly, 1T PdS2 is an indirect band gap semiconductor in its monolayer form but becomes metallic as a bilayer.},

abstract = {We investigate the critical methane concentration (CMC) during the atmospheric-pressure chemical vapor deposition (AP-CVD) of graphene on Cu from CH4. Above the CMC, graphene both nucleates and grows; below the CMC, it etches; while at the CMC, carbon intermediate species attach and detach from graphene at equal rates. By studying how the CMC varies with [H2] and temperature, we determine the reaction mechanism and the intermediates. We find that the CMC scales with [H2]3/2 and determine a single Arrhenius temperature dependence close to the expected equilibrium value. For [CH4] > CMC, the radial growth rate is proportional to the “building unit” supersaturation indicating that graphene growth occurs under capture-limited kinetics through an intermediate hydrocarbon that is first-order dependent on [CH4] and proportional to [H2]−3/2. We develop a CH4 decomposition and capture model which is consistent with all measurements indicating that the intermediate is CH. We find that uniform monolayer graphene can only be achieved in AP-CVD near the CMC, with a nucleation density that varies 5 orders of magnitude from 880 to 1075 °C. Thus, our work also provides a roadmap for growing uniform graphene at atmospheric pressure on Cu over a broad range of experimental conditions.},

Using large-scale electronic structure calculations based on the GW approach, we show that when GNRs are deposited on substrates, bandgaps get strongly suppressed (by as much as 1 eV) even though the GNR-substrate interaction is weak.},

abstract = {The first-principles band theory paradigm has been a key player not only in the process of discovering new classes of topologically interesting materials, but also for identifying salient characteristics of topological states, enabling direct and sharpened confrontation between theory and experiment. We begin this review by discussing underpinnings of the topological band theory, which basically involves a layer of analysis and interpretation for assessing topological properties of band structures beyond the standard band theory construct. Methods for evaluating topological invariants are delineated, including crystals without inversion symmetry and interacting systems. The extent to which theoretically predicted properties and protections of topological states have been verified experimentally is discussed, including work on topological crystalline insulators, disorder/interaction driven topological insulators (TIs), topological superconductors, Weyl semimetal phases, and topological phase transitions. Successful strategies for new materials discovery process are outlined. A comprehensive survey of currently predicted 2D and 3D topological materials is provided. This includes binary, ternary and quaternary compounds, transition metal and f-electron materials, Weyl and 3D Dirac semimetals, complex oxides, organometallics, skutterudites and antiperovskites. Also included is the emerging area of 2D atomically thin films beyond graphene of various elements and their alloys, functional thin films, multilayer systems, and ultra-thin films of 3D TIs, all of which hold exciting promise of wide-ranging applications. We conclude by giving a perspective on research directions where further work will broadly benefit the topological materials field.},

They often crystallize to form atomically smooth thin films, nanotubes, and platelet or fullerene-like nanoparticles due to the anisotropic bonding. Structures that predominately expose edges of the layers exhibit high surface energy and are often considered unstable. In this communication, we present a synthesis process to grow MoS2 and MoSe2 thin films with vertically aligned layers, thereby maximally exposing the edges on the film surface. Such edge-terminated films are metastable structures of MoS2 and MoSe2, which may find applications in diverse catalytic reactions. We have confirmed their catalytic activity in a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), in which the exchange current density correlates directly with the density of the exposed edge sites.},

abstract = {Here, we present a temperature (T) dependent comparison between field-effect and Hall mobilities in field-effect transistors based on few-layered WSe2 exfoliated onto SiO2. Without dielectric engineering and beyond a T-dependent threshold gate-voltage, we observe maximum hole mobilities approaching 350 cm(2)/Vs at T = 300 K. The hole Hall mobility reaches a maximum value of 650 cm(2)/Vs as T is lowered below $\sim$150 K, indicating that insofar WSe2-based field-effect transistors (FETs) display the largest Hall mobilities among the transition metal dichalcogenides. The gate capacitance, as extracted from the Hall-effect, reveals the presence of spurious charges in the channel, while the two-terminal sheet resistivity displays two-dimensional variable-range hopping behavior, indicating carrier localization induced by disorder at the interface between WSe2 and SiO2. We argue that improvements in the fabrication protocols as, for example, the use of a substrate free of dangling bonds are likely to produce WSe2-based FETs displaying higher room temperature mobilities, i.e. approaching those of p-doped Si, which would make it a suitable candidate for high performance opto-electronics.},

abstract = {Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) like molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and tungsten disulfide (WS2) are layered materials capable of growth to one monolayer thickness via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Such CVD methods, while powerful, are notoriously difficult to extend across different reactor types and conditions, with subtle variations often confounding reproducibility, particularly for 2D TMD growth. In this work, we formulate the first generalized TMD synthetic theory by constructing a thermodynamic and kinetic growth mechanism linked to CVD reactor parameters that is predictive of specific geometric shape, size, and aspect ratio from triangular to hexagonal growth, depending on specific CVD reactor conditions. We validate our model using experimental data from Wang et al. (Chem. Mater. 2014, 26, 6371-6379) that demonstrate the systemic evolution of MoS2 morphology down the length of a flow CVD reactor where variations in gas phase concentrations can be accurately estimated using a transport model (CSulfur = 9-965 $\mu$mol/m(3); CMoO3 = 15-16 mmol/m(3)) under otherwise isothermal conditions (700 °C). A stochastic model which utilizes a site-dependent activation energy barrier based on the intrinsic TMD bond energies and a series of Evans-Polanyi relations leads to remarkable, quantitative agreement with both shape and size evolution along the reactor. The model is shown to extend to the growth of WS2 at 800 °C and MoS2 under varied process conditions. Finally, a simplified theory is developed to translate the model into a "kinetic phase diagram" of the growth process. The predictive capability of this model and its extension to other TMD systems promise to significantly increase the controlled synthesis of such materials.},

In the first-principle calculations performed in the density functional theory framework we implement novel functionals accounting for Van der Waals forces and employ to the test cases of graphite and graphene layers. It turns out that this approach provides a solution to the long standing problem of overbinding between graphene layers in bulk graphite, giving the distance between the carbon layers in excellent agreement with experiment. In graphene bilayers, Van der Waals functionals lead to energetic barriers for A–B to A–A ordering of graphene bilayers that are by a factor of two smaller than the barriers obtained with standard functionals. It may be of crucial importance, particularly, if one uses atomistic ab initio methods as a starting point for multi-scale modeling of materials and for determination of effective potentials.},

abstract = {Using selected-area low-energy electron diffraction analysis, we showed strict orientational alignment of monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) crystallites with Cu(100) surface lattices of Cu foil substrates during atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition. In sharp contrast, the graphene-Cu(100) system is well-known to assume a wide range of rotations despite graphene's crystallographic similarity to h-BN. Our density functional theory calculations uncovered the origin of this surprising difference: The crystallite orientation is determined during nucleation by interactions between the cluster's edges and the substrate. Unlike the weaker B- and N-Cu interactions, strong C-Cu interactions rearrange surface Cu atoms, resulting in the aligned geometry not being a distinct minimum in total energy. The discovery made in this specific case runs counter to the conventional wisdom that strong epilayer-substrate interactions enhance orientational alignment in epitaxy and sheds light on the factors that determine orientational relation in van der Waals epitaxy of 2D materials.},

abstract = {The hyperdynamics method is a powerful tool to simulate slow processes at the atomic level. However, the construction of an optimal hyperdynamics potential is a task that is far from trivial. Here, we propose a generally applicable implementation of the hyperdynamics algorithm, borrowing two concepts from metadynamics. First, the use of a collective variable (CV) to represent the accelerated dynamics gives the method a very large flexibility and simplicity. Second, a metadynamics procedure can be used to construct a suitable history-dependent bias potential on-the-fly, effectively turning the algorithm into a self-learning accelerated molecular dynamics method. This collective variable-driven hyperdynamics (CVHD) method has a modular design: both the local system properties on which the bias is based, as well as the characteristics of the biasing method itself, can be chosen to match the needs of the considered system. As a result, system-specific details are abstracted from the biasing algorithm itself, making it extremely versatile and transparent. The method is tested on three model systems: diffusion on the Cu(001) surface and nickel-catalyzed methane decomposition, as examples of ?reactive? processes with a bond-length-based CV, and the folding of a long polymer-like chain, using a set of dihedral angles as a CV. Boost factors up to 109, corresponding to a time scale of seconds, could be obtained while still accurately reproducing correct dynamics.},

Our method relies on the summation of interatomic C6 coefficients, derived from the electron density of a molecule or solid and accurate reference data for the free atoms. The mean absolute error in the C6 coefficients is 5.5% when compared to accurate experimental values for 1225 intermolecular pairs, irrespective of the employed exchange-correlation functional. We show that the effective atomic C6 coefficients depend strongly on the bonding environment of an atom in a molecule. Finally, we analyze the van der Waals radii and the damping function in the C6R(-6) correction method for density-functional theory calculations.},

abstract = {The p-n junction is the functional element of many electronic and optoelectronic devices, including diodes, bipolar transistors, photodetectors, light-emitting diodes and solar cells. In conventional p-n junctions, the adjacent p- and n-type regions of a semiconductor are formed by chemical doping. Ambipolar semiconductors, such as carbon nanotubes, nanowires and organic molecules, allow for p-n junctions to be configured and modified by electrostatic gating. This electrical control enables a single device to have multiple functionalities. Here, we report ambipolar monolayer WSe2 devices in which two local gates are used to define a p-n junction within the WSe2 sheet. With these electrically tunable p-n junctions, we demonstrate both p-n and n-p diodes with ideality factors better than 2. Under optical excitation, the diodes demonstrate a photodetection responsivity of 210 mA W(-1) and photovoltaic power generation with a peak external quantum efficiency of 0.2%, promising values for a nearly transparent monolayer material in a lateral device geometry. Finally, we demonstrate a light-emitting diode based on monolayer WSe2. These devices provide a building block for ultrathin, flexible and nearly transparent optoelectronic and electronic applications based on ambipolar dichalcogenide materials.},

abstract = {An integrated method for modelingchemical vapor deposition on length scales ranging from microns to meters has been developed. The macroscale problem of flow and transport in a single wafer, low pressurechemical vapor deposition reactor is solved using the finite element method. However, on the feature scale, continuum models of flow and transport are not valid and discrete particle transport models must be employed. The two transport regimes, continuum and discrete particle, are linked by an effective reactivity function $\epsilon$ which includes both effects of multiscale surface heterogeneity and microscale transport resistance. A hybridballistic transport,Monte Carlo method, is developed permitting calculation of $\epsilon$ for any set of reaction pathways occurring over microelectronic device features of any geometry. Surface topography, that is, feature scale calculations, are combined to yield an effective reactivity map over the surface of the substrate. This map is subsequently used to formulate a flux boundary condition on the macroscopic model. Iteration between macroscopic and microscopic models is used to assure a consistent set of conditions at the macro–micro interface. The resulting linked models are used for investigation of local and reactor wide loading effects. Matched macroscopic solutions provide inputs for profile evolution calculations during fill of trenches and vias.},

However, many chemical reactions have relatively high activation energies, putting them beyond the times-scale of conventional molecular dynamics (MD) at modest temperatures. To capture the low-temperature long-lived radical chemistry in atomistic simulations, we have developed a new transition detection scheme for performing Reactive Parallel Replica Dynamics (RPRD) simulation enabling an extended MD time-scales, essentially up to a microsecond using ReaxFF. In the newly implemented event detection scheme, the transition events are identified whenever there is a change in connectivity of any atom. 1-Heptene pyrolysis is chosen as a model system, and RPRD simulations are performed at temperatures as low as 1350K for up to 1 $\mu$s for a system consisting of 40 heptene molecules. The chemical mechanism and the product distribution that were obtained from the RPRD simulation are in reasonable agreement with shock tube experiments.},

The extensions include an adaptive treatment of the nonbonded and dihedral-angle interactions, which still allows for covalent bonding interactions. Torsional potentials are introduced via a novel interaction potential that does not require a fixed hybridization state. The resulting model is intended as a first step towards a transferable, empirical potential capable of simulating chemical reactions in a variety of environments. The current implementation has been validated against structural and energetic properties of both gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons, and is expected to prove useful in simulations of hydrocarbon liquids, thin films, and other saturated hydrocarbon systems.},

We have employed a combination of GW (G = Green's function; W = screened Coulomb interaction) calculations of the SAM quasi-particle energies and a semiclassical image potential model to account for surface polarization effects. We find that it is essential to include both quasi-particle corrections and surface screening in order to provide a reasonable estimate of the energy level alignment at a SAM−metal interface.

Semiempirical, and even cer- tain less empirical, ways to do this can be very efficient computationally and have recently been developed to a high level of sophistication, with considerable success. There are, however, effects that are not captured in this way, including surprising dependences of the dispersion energy on the num- ber N of atoms and on separation D. Higher level quantum chemical, perturbative, and random-phase approximation (RPA)-like theories can capture these beyond pairwise effects, but at a high computational cost. Very recent simplified RPA- like approaches based on localized oscillators account for the unusual N dependence in a computationally efficient way. To proceed further, the present work proposes three physically distinct categories of nonpairwise effects (types A, B, and C) against which the performance of existing and future theories can be assessed.},

abstract = {We develop here the methodology for dramatically accelerating the ReaxFF reactive force field based reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) simulations through use of the bond boost concept (BB), which we validate here for describing hydrogen combustion. The bond order, undercoordination, and overcoordination concepts of ReaxFF ensure that the BB correctly adapts to the instantaneous configurations in the reactive system to automatically identify the reactions appropriate to receive the bond boost. We refer to this as adaptive Accelerated ReaxFF Reactive Dynamics or aARRDyn. To validate the aARRDyn methodology, we determined the detailed sequence of reactions for hydrogen combustion with and without the BB. We validate that the kinetics and reaction mechanisms (that is the detailed sequences of reactive intermediates and their subsequent transformation to others) for H2 oxidation obtained from aARRDyn agrees well with the brute force reactive molecular dynamics (BF-RMD) at 2498 K. Using aARRDyn, we then extend our simulations to the whole range of combustion temperatures from ignition (798 K) to flame temperature (2998K), and demonstrate that, over this full temperature range, the reaction rates predicted by aARRDyn agree well with the BF-RMD values, extrapolated to lower temperatures. For the aARRDyn simulation at 798 K we find that the time period for half the H2 to form H2O product is ∼538 s, whereas the computational cost was just 1289 ps, a speed increase of ∼0.42 trillion (10(12)) over BF-RMD. In carrying out these RMD simulations we found that the ReaxFF-COH2008 version of the ReaxFF force field was not accurate for such intermediates as H3O. Consequently we reoptimized the fit to a quantum mechanics (QM) level, leading to the ReaxFF-OH2014 force field that was used in the simulations.},

It is found that: (1) The ZZ-types (ZZ-SV and ZZ-DV) are more stable at different line vacancy densities than the AC-types (AC-SV and AC-DV), which is in good agreement with previous experimental findings. (2) More interestingly, it is predicted from our numerical calculations that, in the same ZZ-types, the ZZ-DV is more stable than the ZZ-SV, indicating that two separate ZZ-SV line vacancy defects tend to move closely to each other for coalescing into a ZZ-DV, which is in contrast to the AC-type with AC-SV being a little more stable than the AC-DV. (3) The monolayer MoS2 with the AC-SV or AC-DV are both semiconductors with a direct or an indirect band gap, respectively, both of which are significantly smaller than that of the perfect monolayer. (4) Furthermore, the out-of-plane distortion induced by strain release in the monolayer MoS2 with ZZ-SV or ZZ-DV is more severe than that with the AC-type, which can further considerably decrease the system's gap value or even make the gap nearly closed.

abstract = {As a promising non-precious catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER; refs ,,,,), molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) is known to contain active edge sites and an inert basal plane. Activating the MoS2 basal plane could further enhance its HER activity but is not often a strategy for doing so. Herein, we report the first activation and optimization of the basal plane of monolayer 2H-MoS2 for HER by introducing sulphur (S) vacancies and strain. Our theoretical and experimental results show that the S-vacancies are new catalytic sites in the basal plane, where gap states around the Fermi level allow hydrogen to bind directly to exposed Mo atoms. The hydrogen adsorption free energy ($\Delta$GH) can be further manipulated by straining the surface with S-vacancies, which fine-tunes the catalytic activity. Proper combinations of S-vacancy and strain yield the optimal $\Delta$GH = 0 eV, which allows us to achieve the highest intrinsic HER activity among molybdenum-sulphide-based catalysts.},

@article{Ross2013,
abstract = {Monolayer group-VI transition metal dichalcogenides have recently emerged as semiconducting alternatives to graphene in which the true two-dimensionality is expected to illuminate new semiconducting physics. Here we investigate excitons and trions (their singly charged counterparts), which have thus far been challenging to generate and control in the ultimate two-dimensional limit. Utilizing high-quality monolayer molybdenum diselenide, we report the unambiguous observation and electrostatic tunability of charging effects in positively charged (X(+)), neutral (X(o)) and negatively charged (X(-)) excitons in field-effect transistors via photoluminescence. The trion charging energy is large (30 meV), enhanced by strong confinement and heavy effective masses, whereas the linewidth is narrow (5 meV) at temperatures <55 K. This is greater spectral contrast than in any known quasi-two-dimensional system. We also find the charging energies for X(+) and X(-) to be nearly identical implying the same effective mass for electrons and holes.},

@article{Garcia-Lastra2009,
abstract = {On the basis of first-principles G0W0 calculations we study systematically how the electronic levels of a benzene molecule are renormalized by substrate polarization when physisorbed on different metallic and semiconducting surfaces. The polarization-induced reduction of the energy gap between occupied and unoccupied molecular levels is found to scale with the substrate density of states at the Fermi level (for metals) and substrate band gap (for semiconductors). These conclusions are further supported by GW calculations on simple lattice models. By expressing the electron self-energy in terms of the substrate's joint density of states we relate the level shift to the surface electronic structure thus providing a microscopic explanation of the trends in the G0W0 calculations. While image charge effects are not captured by semi-local and hybrid exchange-correlation functionals, we find that error cancellations lead to remarkably good agreement between the G0W0 and Kohn-Sham energies for the occupied orbitals of the adsorbed molecule.},

abstract = {The accuracy of the results obtained in molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations crucially depends on a reliable description of the atomic interactions. A large variety of efficient potentials has been proposed in the literature, but often the optimum functional form is difficult to find and strongly depends on the particular system. In recent years, artificial neural networks (NN) have become a promising new method to construct potentials for a wide range of systems. They offer a number of advantages: they are very general and applicable to systems as different as small molecules, semiconductors and metals; they are numerically very accurate and fast to evaluate; and they can be constructed using any electronic structure method. Significant progress has been made in recent years and a number of successful applications demonstrate the capabilities of neural network potentials. In this Perspective, the current status of NN potentials is reviewed, and their advantages and limitations are discussed.},

A fully nonlocal functional form [Phys. Rev.

These key examples show that the DFT with the generalized-gradient approximation does not apply for calculating properties of sparse matter, while use of the fully nonlocal version appears to be one way to proceed.},

We are mainly interested in the limit in which kinetic anisotropy dominates, and hence we study how the expected shape of a crystallite, which in the long-time limit is the kinetic Wulff shape, is modified by anisotropic diffusion. We present results that prove that anisotropic diffusion plays an important, counterintuitive role in the evolving crystal shape, and we add second-order corrections to the model that provide a significant increase in accuracy for small supersaturations. We also study the effect of different crystal symmetries and discuss the influence of the deposition rate.},

@article{Jiang2013a,
abstract = {We present a parameterization of the Stillinger-Weber potential to describe the interatomic interactions within single-layer MoS2 (SLMoS2). The potential parameters are fitted to an experimentally-obtained phonon spectrum, and the resulting empirical potential provides a good description for the energy gap and the crossover in the phonon spectrum. Using this potential, we perform classical molecular dynamics simulations to study chirality, size, and strain effects on the Young's modulus and the thermal conductivity of SLMoS2. We demonstrate the importance of the free edges on the mechanical and thermal properties of SLMoS2 nanoribbons. Specifically, while edge effects are found to reduce the Young's modulus of SLMoS2 nanoribbons, the free edges also reduce the thermal stability of SLMoS2 nanoribbons, which may induce melting well below the bulk melt temperature. Finally, uniaxial strain is found to efficiently manipulate the thermal conductivity of infinite, periodic SLMoS2.},
